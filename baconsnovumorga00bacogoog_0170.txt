tnore serious attention. As, however, the topics which they start are,
for the most part, dealt with elsewhere, either in the Introduction or
in the notes to this Edition, 1 shall here confine myself to avery
brief notice of thern.

ln his Life of N ewton ( 18 5 5)⁶⁸, Sir D. Brewster, irritated apparently
by the injudicious statement of ‘some modern writers of celebrity,'
that Newton ‘owed all his discoveries to the application of the
principles of Bacon,' maintains a proposition equally extreme, and,
as it seems to me, equally untrue, that he did not ‘derive the slightest
advantage from Bacon's precepts.’ For what Ι conceive to bea
refutation of this position, l must refer the reader back to what 1
have already said on the relation of Newton to Bacon ⁶². Taking
occasion of this incidental mention of Bacon, Brewster goes on to

combat his claims generally as a reformet of science. He argues¹
or rather asserts (for, exceptos the first proposition, he adduces

hardly any proof): rst, that ‘the necessity of experimental research,
and of advancing gradually from the study of facts to the determina·
tion of their cause, is a doctrine which was not only inculcated, but
successfully followed by preceding philosophers3’ and, that no
testimonies to the value of Bacon's method have been offered by
those who have actually cultivated science ; 3rd, that, as regards
his own investigation into the nature of heat, ‘the oracle which he
had himself established refused to give its responses, and the minister·
ing priest was driven with discomfiture from his shrine ;' 4th, that
‘a collection of scientific facts are of themselves incapable of leading
to discovery, unless they contain the predominating fact or relation
in which the discovery nrainly resides! Briefly to reply to these
assertions, the first is, within certain limits and with certain explana·
tions, which, however, require to be given, undoubtedly true; the
second 1 conceive that I have already abundantly disproved; as
to the third, Ι believe that the ‘ministering priest’ obtained a far
more luminous answer than oracles are usually in the habit of giving;
with regard to the last, if Sir D. Brewster means that amere collection
of facts, without any play of the mind upon them (‘ permissio intel-
lectus,' as Bacon phrased it, or, as we should say in technical language,
fonnation of hypotheses), is seldom or never lilrely to lead to dis·
covery, 1 cordially agree with him, but then Bacon himself, we must
recollect, was happily inconsistent on this point. Brief as is Sir D.
Brewster’s notice of Bacon, itdeserves considerable attention, because
