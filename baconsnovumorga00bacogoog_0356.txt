Atque insolentiam rei quod attinet: certe si quis manus con·
stantia atque oculi vigore lineam magis rectam aut circulum
magis perlectum se describere posse quam alium quempiam sibi
assumat, inducitur scilicet facultatis comparati03 quod si quis
asserat se adhibita regula aut circumducto circino lineam magis

. rectam aut circulum magis perfectum posse describere, quam

aliquem alium vi sola oculi et manus, is certe non admodum
jactatorsuerit. Quin hoc, quod dicimus, non solum in hoc nostro
conatu primo et incoeptivo locum habet3 sed etiam pertinet ad
eosqui huic rei posthac incumbent. Nostra enirn via inveniendi

⁴⁹ Cp. Aph. 32.

⁶⁰ Cp. Aph. 61 and note 13. This anticipatiorr oi Bacon never has
been, and never can be, realised. There is not, and there never oen be,
a mechanical method ol invention, furnishing rules wbereby men oi
average abilities may invent arts or make discoveries with the same
facility and certainty with which they use a pair os compasses. The
reason oi. this impossibility is to be sougbt uot only in the complexity
and ‘subtlety’ os nature (which Bacon thought to be much simplet than
it is) aud iu tbe laborious and complicated character oi many oi the
processes ol reasoning, but also iu the important and, indeed, iudis-
pensable share which imagination bas iu all scientific discovery. Now
ior the stimulatiou and exercise of the imagination no rules can be given,
though the habitual observatiou oi the ordinary rules oi logie, and
especially oi hypothesis, may be useful in diverting it from improper, and
directiug it into proper chanuels.

Bacon's confidence in tbe ease 3ηά certainty with which his method
might be applied was a direct consequence ol bis theory ol ‘simple
natures.’ ‘This method oi exclusion’ (says Mr. Ellis, E. and S., voli.
pp. 33—6) ‘requires only an attentive consideration oi each “ instantia,”
in order first to analyse it into its simple natures‚ 3ηά secondly to see
which oi the latter are to be excluded—processes which require no higber
faculties than ordinary acuteness and patient diligenoe. There is clearly
no room in this mechanical procedure for the display oi subtlety or of
inventive genius. Bacon’s method therefore' (as he conceived) ‘leads to
certainty, and may be employed with nearly equal success by all men who
are equally diligent! ,
