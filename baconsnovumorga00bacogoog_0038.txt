RELATION TO BACON’S OTHER WORKS. 9

To me the whole perfonnance seems to have a strained and almost
theatrical character.
The composition of me Novum Organum (as I have shewn in the

section on its Bibliography) appears to have been commenced about ’

1608. When the first edition appeared in 1620, it was preceded by
the piece beginning, ‘Franciscus de Verulamio sic cogitavit’ a Dedi·
cation to the King, a Preface to the Instauratio Magna (of which,
though only me second part, it was the first instalment), the Distri-
butio Operis (that is, the plan of the whole Instauration), anda
Preface peculiar to itself. It was followed by a small tract, entitled
Parasceue ad Historiam Naturalem et Experimentalem, printed, by
anticipation, as a sort of specimen or, possibly, resume of the penulti-
mate part of the Novum Organum, promised in ii. 21. Finally the
¹volume is closed by a Catalogus Historiarum Particularium Se-
cundum Capita, or list of desiderata in the specific materials for
induction.

The Novum Organum, I need hardly remark, is onlya fragment
of the much larger work which Bacon contemplated under that title,
as adequately representing the second part of the Great Instauration.
The enumeration of the parts wanting will be found in Book ii.
Aph. 21, and, again, though less distinctly, in Aph. 5²· Nevertheless,
though only a fragment, the Novum Organum, and especially the first
Book, is the most carefully written of all Bacon’s philosophica] works.
According to Rawley¹¹, it was written out twelve several times, and
we have just seen by what a number of essays the final effort was
preceded Moreover, as describing the new method of which the
renovation of knowledge was to be the result, it was the keystone
of Baoon's entire system.

The Third Part of the Great Instauration is designated Phaeno
mena Universi, sive Historia Naturalis et Experimentalis ad con-
dendam Philosophiam, and was to containa collection of arranged
and sifted materials on which the method of induction was to work.
Of this part, even according to Bacon’s limited conception of the
extent and variety of nature, ive have only a very small portion, and,
according to a y'uster estimate of the boondless extent of the ‘Phaeno
mena Univers1,' that portion might almost be described as infini-
tesimal. Such as it is, however, it is contained mainly in the
Historia Ventorum, the Historia Vitae et Mortis, the Historia Densi
et Rari, the Sylva Sylvarum, and the New Atlantis. ln the year 1622
