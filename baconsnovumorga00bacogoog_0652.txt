ΠΒ. ΙΙ. 48. 563

perpetuo trepidant, et irrequiete se agant ⁰⁴, nec statu suo
contenta, nec ulterius ausa progredi. Talis invenitur motus
in corde et pulsibus animalium3 et necesse est ut sit in
omnibus corporibus, quae statu ancipiti ita degunt inter
commoda et incommoda, ut distracta liberare se tentent, et
denuo repulsam patiantur, ettamen perpetuo experiantur ⁶⁶.
(19) Sit Motus Decimus Nonus et postremus, motus ille cui
vix nomen motus competit, et tamen est plane motus. Quem
motum, Motum Decubitus ⁶⁸, sive Motum Exhorrentiae Motus,
vocare licet. Per hunc motum terra stat mole sua ⁰⁷, mo·
ventibus se extremis suis in medium ; non ad centrum

“The word ‘agant’ which occurs in the First Edition, should be
replaced by ‘agunt’ as is done in the Second and Third Editions.

‘⁵ Cp. Historia Densi et Rari, E. and 5., vol. ii. p. 263 : ‘Pulsus cordis
et arteriarum in animalibus fit per irrequietam dilatationem spirituum, et
receptum ipsorum, per vices! ln reading vague and sancilul passages like
these, we must recollect that Harvey did not begin to teach his theory oi
the circulation of the blood till 1619, and that it was not till 1638 that his
great treatise, the ‘Exercitatio Anatomica de hlotu Cordis et Sanguinis in
Animalibus,' was published. Bacon might, itis true, have derived more
precise views than those which he expresses from earlier writers, but there
was nothing specially to direct his attention to this subject.

The T ides and the astronomica] phenomena ol N utation and Libration
might furnish appropriate instances ot the ⁴ Motus Trepidationis’

⁴⁶ Decubitus=lying away from, sc. motion. See F acciolati on decubo.
He quotes Fabius Pictor apud Aul. Gell. lib. x. cap. 15: ‘Pedes lecti, in
quo cubat [sc. flamen Dialis], luto tenui circumlitos esse oportet: et de
eo lecto trinoctium continuum non decubat: neque in eo lecto cubare
alium fas est! Decubitus might, however, simply mean ‘lying down,'
‘reclining,' ‘repose’ (Cp. decumbo.)

On Bacon’s vague and improper use nithe word ⁴ motion,’ see the first
note on this Aphorism. Here it cannot be rendered even by ‘process’ or
‘operation' but we must resort 10 some word of very wide meaning, such
as ‘tendency’ or ‘affection' of matter.

‘lnertia' the property oi which Bacon here speaks, is simply the inca-
pacity os matter to change its own state oi rest or motion. The obscure
notions oi Bacon and his contemporaries about motion prevented them
from seeing that this property applies as much to the tendency of 3 body
in motion to go on moving as to that oi a body at rest to remain at rest.
Fora brief account of the establishment oi the First Law of Motion (which
seems to have been first enunciated by Galileo in 1638), see Whewell's
History os the Inductive Sciences‚ vol. ii. bk. vi. cha.

⁸⁷ Bacou seems never weary of parading his belief in the immobility oi

the earth.
