curn Paracelso delirare juvet, qui (distillationibus suis scilicet
occaecatus) nutritionem per separationem tautum fieri voluit3
quodque in pane vel cibo lateat oculus, nasus, cerebrum,
jecur²⁷; in succo terrae radix, lolium, llos. Etenim sicut
saber ex rudi massa lapidis vel ligni, per separationem et
rejectionem superflui, educit lolium, florem, oculum, nasum,
manum, pedem, et similia; ita Archaeum illum Fabrum28
internum ex alimento per separationem et rejectionem edu-
cere singula membra et partes asserit ille. Verum, missis

‘¹ l borrow, with slight additions, the following note from Mr. Ellis:
‘1 have not been able to lind any passage in Paracelsus which altogether
corresponds to this remark, and in his Modus Pharmacandi the process
ol digestion is described without reference to the Archeus3 nor is it said
that each member ‘⁴ latet in pane vel cibo? “ Hoc scimus, quod cujusque
membri nutrimentum latitet in pane, earne, et in aliis similiter.” “Quot
vero modis et quibus, necnon qua ratione membris corporis nutrimentum
dividatur, nos ignoramus ; hoc tantum scimus, rem ita se habere ut dixi·
mus.''-De Mod Phann [Operum medico-chimicorum sive paradoxomm
tomi undecim genuini, tout] v. p. 233 (1 use the edition ol 1603.)

‘Bacon has, however, correctly stated the general doctrine that alimen-
tation is by separation3 and again Paracelsus affirms that “officium vero
Archei est in microcosmo purum ab impuro separare ” [rather sequestrarel.
—De Morbis Tartareis, [tom] iii. 195. The truth is that Paracelsus'sviews
are so often repeated and varied in the course ol his writings, that it
is difficult to know how lar his opinions are represented by any particular
passage.

‘lt is well to. remark that, to a certain extent, the theory here so de·
cidedly condemned has, by the recent progress ol organic chemistry, been
shown to be true. Nothing seems better established than that the nitro
genised components ol animal bodies are derived from the corresponding
elements ol their lood. With respect to lat, it is, 1 believe, a prevailing

. opinion at present, that animals have the power ol converting into it the
starch or sugar ol their lood [see hlillet's Organic Chemistry‚ Elements ol
Chemistry‚ 4th Ed, vol. iii.§ 1718] ; and the production ol butyric acid
by fermentation has been regarded as at least an illustration ol the
transformation. One ol the highest authorities on suchasubject, however,
l mean M. Boussingault, was, at least a lew years ago, ol a different opinion.
He regarded animal lat as the representative ol the latty matters contained
in the food!

²⁸ Paracelsus is very lond ol this analogy. Thus, in the De Morbis
Tartareis, cap. 3, he says: ‘Ac insuper Archaeum loco et vice fabri praesto
esse debeae’ ilallam (History ol Literature, part. i. ch. 7. §§ 17-20) gives
a short account ot the whimsical theories ol Paracelsus. Foralouger
account, see Sprengel, Geschichte der Anneylrunde, Th. iii. Kap. to
