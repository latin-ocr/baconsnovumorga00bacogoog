autem ait, herbam vocatam Raram Solis ²² meridie et fervente
sole rore impleri, cum aliae herbae undique sint siccae. At
nos utramque narrationem fabulosam esse existimamus. Orn-
nino autem illae instantiae nobilissimi forent usus, et intro-
spectione dignissimae, si essent verae. Etiam rores illos
mellitos, et instar mannae, qui super soliis quercus inveniuntur
mense Maio, non existimamus fieri et densari a consensu
aliqud, sive a proprietate lolii quercus; sed, cum super aliis
soliis pariter cadant, contineri scilicet et durare in foliis quer-
cus, quia sunt bene unita, nec spongiosa, ut plurima ex aliis ²³.

The story may have originated in the observatiou of some plant which
exudes molsture. Such plants are not uncommon, as, lor instance, the
Pitcher Plant, some ol the Musas, the Drosera, next mentioned, &c Or
the plant may have been one on which dew is easily deposited and re-
tained. Or, lastly, the cause might be the constant exudations os small
lnsects. Mr. Andrew Johnson, who adopts this view, quotes Livingstone’s
Travels in South Africa, p. 415: ‘1 badan opportunity ol observing a
cun'ous insect which inhabits trees os the fig family (ficus). Seven or eight
ol them cluster round a spot on one ol the smaller branches, and there
keep up a constant distillation of a clear fluid, which dropping to the
ground forms a little puddle below. ll a vessel is placed under them in
the evening, it contains four or five piuts oi fluid in the moming.'
Mr. Johnson adds: ‘A careless observet might easily suppose this fluid
to be the production os the tree itseli’

Lasalle has a long note on this passage. He quotes, in support oi the
story of the cloud hanging over the tree, an English navigator, one Robert
lade, and supplements the evidence by an observation ol his own, in which
he saw detached masses of sog clinging to the tops os trees. But Cardan's
story seems to imply more than this rationalistic explanation ol it.

²² The Drosera (δροσερά) or Sun-Dew. The glands ol the leaves exude
drops of a clear glutinous fluid, glittering like dev-dmps, whence the
name

Mr. Ellis says: ‘1 have not been able to find this in Paracelsus. lt
seems, however, to accord with his theory of dew,-namely, that it is an
exudation from the sun and stars; the suppression oi which would lead to
the sonnation os additional suns!

‘⁶³ The honey-dew on the oak, lime, rose-trec, plum-nee, dre, is in all
probability due to a sugary exudation from the Aphis. For a description
of this insect, its devastations, and its exudations, see the Rev. J. G. Wood's
lnsects at Home, p. 542, &o

N one os the three examples adduced by Bacon, it will be noticed, are
really instances ol ‘ condensation.’ The phenomena all arise from exuda-
tion, either oi the plant itself or ol an insect settling on the plant.
