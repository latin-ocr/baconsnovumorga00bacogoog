8 INTRODUCTION.

of the Novum Organum, On the other hand, in the Partis Secundae
Delineatio, as Mr. Spedding remarks in his Preface to that work
(vol. iii. p. 544), ‘the description of the laeserant ad Rationem
adds something to what we otherwise know concerning those parts
of the inductive process which were to have been developed in the
,third book of the Novum Organum’ Appended to the Delineatio
in Ellis and Spedding’s Edition is a tract called Redargutio Philo
sophiarum ⁸, which, says Mr. Spedding, ‘may be considered as the
first chapter of the second part of the Instauratio, as it was then
designed.' It consists, as its name implies, of an attack upon pre
ceding systems of philosophy, and, though designed to be part of
the work of which the Delineatio is the sketch, was probably not
composed till some time afterwards ⁹. Closely resembling the
Redargutio, but far more arrogant in its tone, is the extant portion
of another work entitled Temporis Partus Masculus, sive De Inter-
pretatione Naturae Libri Tres, Of this work the first and second
chapters only exist, the second, as Mr. Spedding thinks, written at a
considerable interval after the first, though before the Redargutio.
This second chapter goes over the same ground as the Redargutio
and the aphorisms on the Idola Theatri in the Novum Organum,
but is written in a peculiarly arrogant, not to say insolent, tone.
Mr. Spedding conjectures, I think rightly, that this anogance and
exaggeration are to be explained on the supposition that Bacon was
making an experiment in the art of commanding attention and
winning disciples ¹⁰. If he spoke loud enough, and used sufficiently
strong language, he thought he might compel men to listen to him.

vol. iii. p. 621, &a 'l'bis plece is followed in Ellis and Spedding's Edition by a
rougb and imperfect draught of an enquiry on Heat and Cold, written probably in
1608.

⁸ In Isaac Gruter's Edition, only a small portion of the Redargutio (namely to
the words ‘in chorum receptis,' E aud S., vol. iii. p. 561) follows the Delineatio.
But in the Appeudix to Mallet's Life of Bacon (1760), the same tract, with the
title, beginning at the words ‘Dum haec tractarem' (E. and S., p. 558), is printed
for the first time from the Harleian MSS. Thus, the two copies over-lap. and
Mr. Spedding has restored the tract by piecing them together.

⁹ See Mt. Spedding's Preface, wok iii. pp. 544-546.

¹⁰ In the Prefaoe to the Delineatio (p. 545), Mr. Spedding quotes, amongst
others, the two following entries from Bacon's Diary (the Commentarius Solutus),
dated July 26, 1608:

'Discoursing scomfully of the philosophy of the Grecisns, with some better
respect to the AEgyptians, Persians, Caldees, aud the utmost antiqnity, and tbe
mysteries of the poete)

‘Compariug the case with that which Livy seyeth of Alexander, Nil alind quam
bene ansus vane contemnere!
