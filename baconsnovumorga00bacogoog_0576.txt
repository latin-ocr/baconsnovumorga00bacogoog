tactum, quemadmodum omnes motus congregativi3 sed cor-
pora tantum elevet, aut ea intumescere faciat, nec quicquam
ultra. Nam si luna attollat aquas ¹⁰, aut turgescere aut
intumescere faciat humida ¹¹3 aut eoelum stellatum attrahat
planetas versus sua apogaea3 aut sol alliget astra Veneris
et Mercurii ¹², ne longius absint a corpore ejus quarn ad
distantiam certam; videntur hi motus nec sub congregatim
majore nec sub congregatione minore bene collocari, sed esse

tanquam congregativa media et imperfecta, ideoque speciem
debere constituere propriam.

¹⁰ See ii. 45 and notes 13, 14, both for this passage and for the one below
on the attraction of the planete by the coelum stellatum.

¹¹ Cp. Historia Densi et Rari (Ε. and S.‚ vol. ii. p. adol: ‘Recepta est
opinio, humores et succos, non in animalibus tantum sed et in plantis, sub
pleniluniis magis turgescere, et cava implere! Cp. Cicero, Debivinatione,
ii. 143 Pliny, Nat. Hist. ii. 99, 101 (102, 104), sects. 201, &c.; Horace

than that of the earth. Whether referred to the heliocentric or geocentric
system, the pecrdiarities of these planets early attracted attention. On the
geocentric hypothesis, it was doubted whether their orbits were superior
or inferior to that of the sun. Bacon starts various questions with re-
gard to them in me Descriptio Globi Intellectualis (E. and S.‚ vol. iii.

As to the words ‘ne longius absint’ dic, the best commentary on them
will be found in Herschel‘s Outlines of Astronomy, roth Ed„ ξ 467, &c
Herschel begins his account of the motions of these planets almost in the
very words of Bacon: ‘Two of the planets-—Mercury and Venus-perfonn
their circuit evidently as attendants upon the sun, from whose vicinity
they never depart beyond a certain limit.’

¹⁸ The following excellent remarks on this section are made by Dr.
Hippus in his Account of the Novum organum in the Library of Useful
Knowledge: ‘Motus sugas, or the motion of avotiionce, though very crudely
and almost ludicrously illustrated by Bacon, has its foundation in fact, and
is that property of matter which is now called repulsi'on. Newton found
that a convex lem, when put upon aflat glass, remained at the distance of
the ffith part of an inch ; and that a very considerable force was requisito
to diminish this distance. Again, though steel is so much beavierthan its
bullr of water, yet if a dry needle be placed oarefully upon the suriace of a
basin of water, it will float; me repulsion of the water preventing its

siuking. Also the particles oi all gaser seem to repel each other, as appears
