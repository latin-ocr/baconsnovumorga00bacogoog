BACON’S INFLUENCE ΟΝ SCIENCE. 113

informal meetings during the Civil Wars (according to Dr. Wallis in
1645), though it did not receive its Charterof Incorporation till 1662.
Now Bishop Sprat, its earliest historian, in a work written in 1667,
speaks of Bacom as having ‘had the true imagination oi the whole
extentos this enterprise, as it is now seton soor! And then he
proceeds: ‘In whose books there are everywhere scattered the best
arguments, that carr be produced ior the d'esence ol Experimental
Philosophy ; and the best directions that are neediul to promote it.
All which he has already adorned withso much art: that is my desires
could have prevailed with some excellent friends os mine, who engaged
me to this work: there should have been no other Preiace to theHistory
of the Royal Society, but some ol his writings.’ The passage is too
long to quote at length, but vill be found in Dr. Sprat’s History oi
the Royal Society, pp. 35, 36, and in Tenison’s Baconiana, pp. 264-
266. What Sprat, notwithstanding his eulogium of the philosophical
works in general, says of the Sylva Sylvarurn is unfortunately very
true: ‘He seems rather to take all that comes, than to choose ; and
to heap rather than to register! ‘But’ he adds, though ‘he had not
the strength of a thousand men, I do allow him to have bad as much
as twenty)

In another place (p. 144), aiter complimenting Lord Clarendon
and the other Law Officers oi the Crown on their share in drawing
up the Charter oi the Royal Society, Sprat goes on to say: ‘But
it is enough to declaro that my Lord Bacon was a Iauyer, and that
these eminent officers oi the Law have completed this foundation ol
the Royal Society: which wasa work well becoming the largeness of
his Wit to devise, and the greatness os their Prudence to establish’
The allusion here, I presume, is to the New Atlantis.

ln Cowley's Ode to the Royal Society, Bacon's name is equally
prominent:

‘Some few exalted Spirits this latter Age has shown,
That labour'd to assert the Liberty
(From Guardians, who were now Usnrpers grown)
Οἱ thir Old Minor still, captiv'd Philosophy;

But ’twas Rebellion call¹d to light

For such a long oppressed Right.
Baoon at last, a mighty man, arose

Whom a wise King and Nature chose
Lord Chaneellour ol both their Laws,

And boldly undertook the injur'd Pupil's cause!
He then describes how he chased away Authority,

‘Nor suffer'd Living men to be misled
By the vein shadows ol the Dead z’
