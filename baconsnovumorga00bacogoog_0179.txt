150 INTRODUCTION.

182 5-1836, and the truly valuable and splendid edition ol Ellis,
Spedding‚ and Heath, longmans, 1857, &c Bouillet¹s Edition oi
the Philosophical Works will be noticed below.

The following are the principal works on Bacon’s 'philosophy in
general or the Novum Organum in particular, which have fallen
under my notice. I omit merely popular lectures, or chapters in
Histories os Philosophy, some ol the latter of which, however, such,
lor instance, as those of Brucker, Lenes, Ueberweg‚ dc, are of con-
siderable merit. On the other hand, 1 insert short notices ol the
Baconian Philosophy, which would otherwise be likely to escape the
readeds attention.

Voltaire. kettres sur les Anglois. lettre XII. About 1728. This
letter is reproduced, with additions, in the Dictionnaire Philosophique.

The Encyctopedie began to appear in ¹75¹· See Discours Pre-
liminaire, pp. 24, 2 5, and Article on Bacon.

Analyse de la Philosophie du Chancellier Francois Bacon, avec sa
vie, &c par Α. Deleyre. Amsterdam and Paris, 17 5 53 Leyden, 1756.
Only a small portion of this work refers to the Baconian philosophy
properly so called, but in the Prelace to the work Le Christianisme

tto, noticed below, the author says that Bacon is hardly known to the
majority ol men ol letters in France, except through this Analysis ol

his Philosophy. The book was published anonymously.

Bouillet refers toan Essay on the Philosophy ol Bacon by Ulrich,
Berlin, 1780.

In the Encyclopedie Methodique, Philosophie Ancienne et
Moderne‚ there is a long article on ‘Baconisme' signed by M.
Naigeon, giving a classified account of Bacon’s opinions on various
topics. This article, in which the author follows the estimate ol '
Bacon taken by the Encyclomdists, appeared in 1791. It incor-
porates most ol Deleyre's Analysis

le Sage, in along letter in the Bibliotheque Britannique, Sciences
et Αηε, tome ix, Genera, 1798, brings together a number of quotations
from Bacon, for the purpose oi shewing that he did not reject the
enquiry into the general causes of phenomena. In tome viii. of the
same series, there is a letter by Ie Sage, not expressly written on
Bacon, but occasionally alluding to or quoting him. Neither of these
articles, however, seems to correspond with the one referred to by
De Remusat (p. 392), as contained in tome viii.
