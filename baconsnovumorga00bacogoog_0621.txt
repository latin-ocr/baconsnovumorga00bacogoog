⁸⁰ Bacon alludes to these monks on two other occasions, namely in the
Historia Vitae et Mortis (E. and S., vol ii. p. 131), where he calls them
Foliatani, and in the Sylva sylvarum, Exp. 45, where he calls them
Foliatanes.

l borrow the following note from Mr. Ellis: ‘Bacon doubtless refers to
the austerities of the order of Fabillans. Jean de la Barridre, aster holding
the Cistercian abbey of Fetiillans in commendam sor eleven years, re·
nounced the world in 1573, and in the course os a lew years introduced
a most austere mle ol lile into tbe abbey of which he was the head. His
monks knelt on the tioor during their reiections, and some oi them were
iu the babit os drinking out of skulls. They abstained from eggs, fish,
butter, oil, and even salt, and confined themselves to pottage made os
herbs boiled in water, and bread so coarse and black that beasts refused to
eat oi it. Alter a while they gave up wine also. Clement Vlll permitted
the society to draw up constitutions sor the establishmeut os their rule.
By these the excessive rigour os their way os lise was checked, which was
done in obedience to the Pope, and in consequence oi the deaths ol
lourteen monks in a single week at Feiiillans. These constitutions were
ratified in 1595. Assuming‚ oi which there seems no doubt, that the
F olitani of Bacon are the F eiiillans, 1 may remark that the Latinised form
oi Feiiillans used is F uliensis, as an adjective; the proper style ol the
society being “Congregatio Cistertiomonastica B. Mariae fuliensis3’ 1
have not seen the work ol Morotius to which Helyot, from whom the pre·
ceding account is taken, refers ; but in that of C. Henrique, also mentioned
by Helyot, 1 do not find any authority lor Folitani. lt is probable that
Bneou's chies inionnation on the subject was gathered orally during his
residence in France, before the Feiiillnns had ceased from their first love.
The expression “ordo a s r sere evanuit ” must be taken to mean that the
severe rule that they had at first was given up. See Helyot, Hist. des
Ordres Monastiques‚ ivm partie, c. 38. [Tome v.] spondanus, Au. 1586,
iv. For some particulare of the early history oi the Abbey oi Feiiillans,
and especially lor the will os Jean dela Barriere, see Voyage Litteraire de
deux Benedictins, ii. p. 16!

The Histoire des Ordres Monastiques was published anonymously at
Paris, in 8 vols, the first appearing in 1714. ln the Voyage Litteraire, &o
(which was written by Edm. Martdne and Urs. Durand), there occursacopy
oi a Bull, in which the Latinised formos the Order is Congregatio F euil·

in the Bibliotheque Nationale), entitled‘ Cistercii Reflorescentis, seu Cong.
