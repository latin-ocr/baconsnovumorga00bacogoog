induit serrum nova partium dispositione et motu conformi3
ipse autem nihil ex virtute perdit. Similiter fermentum panis,
et flos cervisiae ³⁹, et coagulum lactis, et nonnulla ex venenis,
excitant et invitant motum 10 massa farinaria, aut cervisia,
aut caseo, aut corpore humano, successivum et continuatum
000 tam ex vi excitantis quam ex praedispositione et facili
cessione excitati.

(13) Sit Motus Decimus Tertius Motus Impressrbnm⁴⁰,·
qui motus est etiam ex genere motus assimilationis, estque
ex diflusivis motibus subtilissimus. Nobis autem visum est
eum in speciem propriam constituere, propter differentiam

sensui nec experimento subjiciantur. llla, cum a calore coelestium primo
longius, deinde penitus, semota sint, possint esse corporibus nobis notis
densiora’ ‘Cum lons densitatis videatur esse in profundo terrae, adeo
ut versus superficiem ejus corpora eximie extenuentur3 illud notatu dig·
num est, quod aurum,' dcc. He then proceeds to ask why gold, which is
so heavy, should be found on the surlace 01 the earth.

⁸⁹ Yeast. ‘The tiower 01 beer! For cervisia, see Pliny, lib. sotii. ad fin.

ln consequence 01 the researches 01 Ρο01001 and others, the generally
received opinion as to the working 01 yeast and leaven is that 11 is due to

a chemical action set up by the lile processes 01 minute organisms which ’

have an indefinite power 01 sels-multiplication. (See Watts’ Dictionary 01
Chemistry, art. ι1011000101100,ν both 10 vol. 11. and 10 1110 supplement.)
The opposed view, held by Liebig and others, attributing these changes
entirely to chemical and physical lorces, seems to have been set aside by
recent experimenta Hence, these phenomena must be regarded as illus·
trating the last section rather than the present one. Putreiaction (see
note 98 above) is a particular case 01 100000101100.

The coagulation 01 milk, when spontaneous, is also probably due to
chemical action set up by minute living organisms. But, when pmduced
by artificial means, as by an aeid, the phenomenon is purely chemical, and
may, therefore, be regarded as an example 01 1110 ‘motus excitationis.⁸

As to poisons, we must distinguish three 00000. 50100 0010000, like
vaccinevirus, are due to the indefinite seli-multiplication 01 low organisms
within the body. Others, like arsenic, act purely chemically. Lastly‚ 0
third class, like chlorolorm 01 prussic aeid, act, as it were, physiologically,
by destroying the dynamical activity 01 00100 tissue or organ. 1 am

⁴⁰ This ‘motus' is distinguished from the two last by the continuance 01
the original impressions being necessary to the continuance 01 1110 0110010.
Thus light or sound ceases, when the source ol the impression is with-
