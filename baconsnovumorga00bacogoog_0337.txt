In constituendo autem axiomata forma inductionis alia

⁹⁶ That is, such as may be shown to include the axiomata media ; laus,
in lact, ol which the axiomata media are particular cases, admitting ol
verification. The laws or motion, as now stated, or the law oi gravity‚ or
the lawoi definite proportions in Chemistry, would be instances of the kind
oi ‘axiomata generalissima’ which Bacon bad in view. With thern we
may compare such ‘abstract and notional’ first principles, as ‘Every body
seelrs its own place,’ or ‘The celestia] motions are circula: or ‘Nature
does nothing in vain! lt was not the generality ol the old ‘axiomata
generalissima‚’ but their vagueness and the slight extent to which they
rested on ascertained laets, and the unwillingness os men to submit them
to verification, which caused them to be so serious an obstacle to the ad·
vance ol science. No laws, oi which we can at present lorm any concep·
tion, can be more general than the Laws of Motlon, but, at the same time,
no generalisations can he more precisely stated, and none can rest on a
wider basis of evidence or account lor a larger number of facts.

⁹⁶ The truth is that men require both wings and ballast. Aman cannot
have too senile an imagination, but his imaginative powers should be com·
bined with a keen perception os the requirements ol evidence and with
corresponding critical acumen. Bacon has really hit the mark in Aph. 57.

⁹² On the Inductio per Enumerationem Simplicem‚ and the distinction
between it and Scientific Induction (‘quae ad inventionem et demonstra-
tionem scientiarum et artium est utilis ³), see my Inductive Logic, 4th
ed, pp. 7—9, 122-124‚215-222,276-295. In reading these passages, the
student must distinguish between the legitimate and illegitimate, as vehas
between the necessary and unnecessary, employment of the Inductio per
Enumerationem Simplicem‚
