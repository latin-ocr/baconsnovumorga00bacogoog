BACON’S USAGE OF ‘FORMR 57

girum 3 praesertim cum hoc vocabulum invaluerit, et familiariter
occurrat’ Again, in ii. 5, we have the expression ‘leges sunda-
mentales et communes, quae constituunt tonnas) But, perhaps, the
most explicit passage ol all is that in ii. 17: ‘Nos enim quurn de
formis loquimur, nil aliud intelligimus, quam leges illas et determina·
tiones actus puri quae naturam aliquam simplicem ordinant et con-
stituunt, ut calorem, lumen, pondus, in omnimoda materia et subjecto
susceptibili. Itaque eadem res est forma calidi aut forma luminis, et
lex calidi sive lex luminis.‘

Now, these various passages admit, I think, ol being ranged under

two classes, according as the word ‘Form' may be replaced by words ’ἲ

like essence, differentia, definition, δια, or by words like law, cause,
lire.³⁸ In the sust class of passages, we may, perhaps, best anive at
Bacon’s meaning by distinguishing the different kinds oi attributes
which may be predicated ol any substance or quality. Leaving out
purely occidental attributes, which are sometimes prediooble and
sometimes not, these may be divided into such as are derived from
other attributes, as effects from causes, and those which, so far as we
can ascertain, are independent and underived The latter are what
may be called the essentia] attributes, and, taken together, constitute,
in the most intelligible sense which can be attached to that word, the
essence os the substance, class, or quality³⁹. When we attempt to express
the essence in words, we enumerate the essential qualities, or construet
its definitivo. But the important or characteristic part of the delinition
is the differentia ,· ior the genus may be regarded as aheady known
before we begin to define, our obiect being to discover the differentia
or differentiae which distinguish the term defined from certain other
terms which sall under the same genus. We see, then, how, from the
conception of the aggregate of independent and underived (or, as we

might call thern, pn'mary) attributes, we are able to explain alike the
expressions ol essence, definition, and differentia, whether applied to
a class (as, say, man or horse), or to what is ordinarily called a sub
stance (as, say, gold), or to a quality (as, say, beat). Itis only to
the last oi these, however, namely qualities or ‘simple natures,' that
Bacon regarded his method as, at least immediately, applicable.

⁸¹ There is one passage (i 75), in which the two manings ore brought togethert
‘Hinc opinio, quod formae sive verae rerum differentiae (qnae revera sunt leges
actus pori) inventu impossibiles sint, et ultra hominem.¹
