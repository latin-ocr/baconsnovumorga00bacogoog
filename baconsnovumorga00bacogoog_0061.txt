Morgan says⁷⁹, ‘the question whether Copemicus himself was a
Copemican in the modern sense of the word is not easily settled.
His phraseology is almost always that ofa mathematical Copernican.
In a very few places, and cautiously, be leans to the physical truth
as probable, and to the diumal motion as more probable than the
torbitaL’ It was not till the discovery of the satellites of Jupiter by
Galileo in 1609, that the Copemican system could be said to be
recommended by any other important considerations than those of its .
simplicity. This important discovery, which was announced to the
μ world in the Sydereus Nuncius in 1610, irresistibly suggested an
¹ analogy between the small system of Jupiter, now ocularly demon-
strated, and the large system of the Sun, as depicted theoretically by
the followers of Copemicusw. From this point the controversy
assumed a new phase, as is evidenced‚ amongst other things, by the
increased warmth of the dispute. Even still, however, and notwith-
standing the mathematical precision given to the theory by the
investigations of Kepler (whose work De Motibus Stellae Martis
was published in 1609), it cannot be said that, till the laws of formal
astronomywere connected by Newton with the physical laws of matter
and motion, the motions of the earth or its relation to the rest of the
'solar system could in any way be regarded as placed beyond the
range of dispute. In Bacon’s time, and especially during the earlier
period of his life, men might be well excused who suspended their
judgment, or who even preferred to adhere to the old assumption till
their objections to the new theory were removed. The following
sentences from Mr. De Morgan ⁸¹ are so apposite, and read a lesson
so universally useful to us, in estimating the scientific jndgments of
men in past ages, that 1 am sure my readers will be grateful to
me for transcribing them. ‘By investing Copemicus with a system
which requires Galileo, Kepler, and Newton to explain it, and their
pupils to understand it, the modern astronomer refers the want of

interesting papers by the late Professor De Morgan, one entitled, ‘Old Arguments

⁸⁰ Even Bacon was sufficiently moved by this discovery to include among his
affirmations in the Thema Coeli (E. and S.. vol. iii. p. 780), ‘soliseqninm ex natura
