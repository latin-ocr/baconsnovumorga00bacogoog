METHOD OF EXCLUSIONS. 63

1 have pointed out in the notes 00 Aphs. 15 and 16 01 Book ii,
are vitiated through his ignoring this circumstance. ·.

1 may remark, lastly, that the soree 01 Bacon’s argument is much
more apparent, as well as really greater, when stated affirmatively
than negatively. 11 1110 connexion between two phenomena or
‘naturas’ satisfies all the requirements 01 1110 Inductive Methods (and,
on a liberal interpretation, we may regard all these requirements
as stated in Nov. Org. 11. 15), we are surely justified, without going
through any ‘exclusion’ 01 011101 0010100, 10 affirming a causal
relation between them. On the other hand, however large the
number 01 ‘natures' which we can succeed 10 excluding, we can
hardly ever be certain, 10 1110 present state 01 knowledge or any
which we are likely to attain, that we have excluded all but one.
And, even supposing we are able to attain this certainty, how do
we know, unless we have some positive evidence, that the remaining
nature is the cause or ‘form' os the given nature? Might they not
both be, so far as our knowledge reaches, ultimate sacts 01 001010,
0011010111100 01 0001110100οε, like Inertia and Gravity ⁴⁸? That Bacon
should have overlooked this objection to his method is the more
remarkable, when we take into account Aph. 48 01 Book i, where he
000010 10 be warning his readers against the commission 01 11110 very
error ⁵⁰.

On the whole, it will be seen that Bacon greatly exaggerated the
value 01 11110 method, though the elimination 01 error is undoubtedly
a most important step towards the discovery 01 110111, and though,
in the course 01 1110 exposition, he enunciates a number 01 10100 and
maxims which contain the germ 01 100011 which is most valuable in
the modern Theory 01 Induction.

1 cannot close this section without bearing my testimony to the
excellence 01 Mr. Ellis's remarks on the subject here discussed. See
his ‘General Presace to the Philosophical Works,' vol. i. pp. 32-39.
What I have said ought not to prevent the student 11010 having
recourse to this additional assistance on one 01 1110 10001 obscure
topics connected with Bacon’s system.

ω Ἀ1 majore cum pernicie intervenit haec impotentia mentis in inventione
causarum: nam 00111 maxime universalia in natura positiva 0000 debeant, quemad-
modum inveniuntur, oeque sunt revera oausabiliat tamen intellectus humanus,
nescius acquiescere, adhuc appetit notiora'
