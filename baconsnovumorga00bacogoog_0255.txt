⁷⁸ Capricious or arbitrary.

⁷⁹ Bacon means that the Will and the Affections olten exert an inllu-
euce in warping our judgrnents. F amiliar illustratione arethe obstinacy
with which men defend opinions to which they have once committed
themselves, and the jealousy and repugnante with which they are apt to
receive those ol their antagonists or rivals. lt was a saying ol Archbishop
Whately, that men are much more anxious to have truth on their side,
than to be on the side ol truth.

lt does not appear to me that Bacon either states orimplies that, is the In-
tellect were lreed from the warping influences of the Will and the Affections,
its conclusions would be infallibly true. Alater school ol English moralists,
of whom Dr. Samuel Clarke is the principal representative, maintained
the doctrine that the Affections are the sole cause os moral aberrations,
but to ascribe this or any similar theory to Bacon would involve an ana-
chronism and be inconsistentwith the language oi the precedingAphorisms.

Spinoza, in his brief criticisrn ol Bacon's philosophy (see his letter to
Oldenburg, Epist. 2, ed. Broder, vol. ii. pp. 146, 7), makes special reference
to this Aphorism.

⁵⁰ The thought is that superstition makes men afraid os enquiring into
the ‘deep things’ ol nature, and so determines them to refer to the action
or intentions of a F irst Cause, what is really due to second causes. ·

⁸¹ lt is, perhaps, almost superfluous to remark that, since Bacon's time,
the ‘ dulness, incompetency, and deceptions' ol the senses have been, to
a great extent, remedied by the discovery ol new instrumente, by methods
of corrections, and by a more carelul discrimination between our original
pereeptiuns and the subsequent operations ol the intellect upon them.
