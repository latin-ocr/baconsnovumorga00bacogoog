verum etiam ad notiones terminandas ⁹, utendum est. Atque
in hac certe inductione spes maxima sita est.

CVI.

At in axiomatibus constituendis per hanc inductionem,
examinatio et probatio etiam facienda est: utrum qnod con·
stituitur axioma aptatum sit tantum et ad mensuram factum
eorum particularium ex quibus extrahitur; an vero sit am-
plius et latius¹⁰. Quod si sit amplius aut latins, videndum
an eam suam amplitudinem et latitudinem per novorum
particularium designationem, quasi fide-jussione quadam,
firmet ¹¹3 nevel in jam notis tantum haereamus, vel laxiore
fortasse complexu umbras et formas abstractas, non solida et
determinata in materia, prensemus. Haec vero cum in usum
venerint, solida tum demum spes merito affulserit.

Atque hic etiam resumendum est, quod superius dictum
est¹² de Naturali Philosophia producta et scientiis particulari·

⁹ Thus, for instance, if we active at atrne axium on the nature of beat,
we shall be better able to define the term or notion. Cp. Aph. 14 and
note 17.

¹⁰ Cp. Aph. 70 and note 74. We here again come across the distinction
since expressed by the terms ‘Empirical Law’ and ‘ Law of Nature!

²¹ Mr. Adamson (Encyclopaedia Britannica, vol. iii. p. 217) is quite right
in saying that this Aphon'sm appears to introduce the idea of hypothesis.
He might also have added that it introduces the idea of verification,
including prediction. As to the nature of the ‘fidejussio’ l may remark
that the circumstance of a scientific generalisation enabling us to predict
the future affords a strong confirmation of its truth, though it does not
positively prove it. See my Inductive Logic, 4th ed, pp. 113-119.

Mr. Spedding very appositely quotes the following passage from Valerius
Terminus (E. and S., vol. iii. p. 242) : ‘That the discovery of new works
and active directions not known before, is the only trial to be accepted of ;
and yet not that neither, in case where one particular giveth light to
another; but where particulare induce an axium or observation, which
axiom found ont discovereth aud designeth new particulare. That the
nature of this trial is not only upon the point, whether the knowledge
be profitable or no, but even upon the point whether the knowledge be
true or uo; not because you may always conclude that tbe Axium which
discovereth new instances is true, but contrariwise you may safely conclude
that if it discover not any new instance it is in vain and untrue!
