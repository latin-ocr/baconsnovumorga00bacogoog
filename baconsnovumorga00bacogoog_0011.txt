vi PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.

antiquarian portions os the work, would hardly have
been necessary sor merely educational purposes. On
the other hand, is lcould always have relied on the
cooperation of a mature student, some ol the rese·
rences and many, perhaps, os the explanations might
have been spared. But, as a rule, Ι think, the results
aimed at by the two objects have pretty nearly
coincided, and Ι have thought it, at least, safer
to err on the side of offering too much elucidation
rather than too little.

The position oi Baeon mid-way, as it were, between
Scholasticism, on one side, and Modern Philosophy
and Science, on the other, is so interesting that I
cannot but think that much has even still to be learnt
srom the study os his works, and especially os this,
the chies and most influential of them all. Not
only is the Novum Organum a collection of fine
sayings and suggestive remarks, but a knowledge of
it is indispensable to the student os the History either
oi Logic, os Philosophy, or os the Physical Sciences.
Moreover, it furnishes an excellent starting-point in
the history os any of these subjects, whether we wish
to go backwards or lorwards. But this very fact
renders it essential that it should be accompanied
with a copious commentary‚ both to point out the
objects of interest, and to institute comparisons with
what the reader has seen or will see elsewhere. Nor
is the interest os the work simply historical. As 1
have pointed out in the section oi the Introduction
devoted to that subject, its present value to the student

of philosophy or logic is als0, I believe, by no means
inconsiderable.
