itionem naturae suae; aut si quisdicat motus rerum tendere
ad conservationem et bonum, vel universi, ut antitypiam et
atrorum,¹ vel universitatum magnarum, ut motus congregatio·
tras majoris, rotationis, et exhorrentiae motus: vel formarum
specialium, ut reliquos. Licet enim haec vera sint, tamen
nisi terminentur ⁷⁰ in materia et labrica secundum veras lineas,
speculativa sunt, et minus utilia. Interim sufficient et boni
erunt usus ad pensitandas praedominantias virtutum et ex·
quirendas instantias luctae ,· id quod nunc agitur.

Etenim ex his quos proposuimus motibus alii prorsus sunt
invincibiles; alii aliis sunt fortiores, et illos ligant, fraenant,
disponunt3 alii aliis longius jaculantur3 alii alios tempore et
celeritate praevertunt3 alii alios fovent, roborant, ampliant,
accelerant.

Motus antitypiae omnino est adamantinus et invincibilis.
Utrum vero Motus nexus sit invincibilis adhuc haeremus.
Neque enim pro certo affirmaverimus ⁷¹ utrum detur Vacuum,
sive coacervatum sive permistum ⁷². At de illo nobis constat,

²⁰ Be ‘defined' or ‘limited’

⁷¹ ln ii. 8, Bacon absolutely denies the existence os a vacuum. See note
on that passage and also note 59 on the ‘ Motus Secundus! ln the latter
note, l have referred to Bacon's change oi opinion on the subjectos
a vacuum, and have quoted a ‘ Canon’ from the Historia Densi et Rari
(which work, or, at least, the 'latter part os it, was written during his
last ‘quinquennium '), where he says: ‘Non est vacuum in natura, nec
congregatum nec intermistum.¹ See E. and S, vol. ii. p. 303. Taking
that as his last utterance on the subject, and bearing in mind the positive
manner in which he speaks inii. 8, as also the apparent bias os i. 66 and
ii. 48 (2), we must, l think, notwithstanding the expressions os doubt in
the present passage, regard him as having deliberately rejected the doctrine
otavacuum.

τ’ Ι borrow the following note from Ellis and Speddings Edition:
“‘Vacuum permistum,'’ κενὸν ἀχώριστον, is vacuum diffused through the
interstices of any portion os matter. By “vacuum coacervatum,” κενὸν
κεχωρισμένον, is meant clear empty space. See, sor this distinction,
Aristotle, Phys. iv. 7 [p. 214]. Hero os Alexandria, whom Bacon mentions
more than once, approves os those who admit the former kind οῖ’ vacuum
and reject the latter. See the Introduction to his Spiritalia.

⁴[1t is perhaps worth observing that in the table entitled “Cupido sive
Atomus’' (De Sap. Vet. xvii), where the theory os a vacuum is mentioned,
this distinction was not introduced till Bacon revised the work in his later
years. The passage which stands thus in the original edition (1609)-
“Quisquis autem atomum ponit et vacuum, necessario virtutem atomi ad
