illas in liquidis, per quas illa dum pressa sint, antequam se
liberare possunt, se invicem relevant, ut compressionem illam
ex aequo tolerent, motui libertates verius assignamus.

magis aut minus impediuntur aut provehuntur a mediis

aliud calori et frigori, aliud virtutibus magneticis, necnon
aliis nonnullis respective.

⁶³ On the medium oi Light, cp. Topica Inquisitionis De Luce et
Lumine, x, xi (E. and S, vol. ii. p. 320), and Sylva Sylvarum, Exps. 761-2,
where he notices the phenomenonot' Refractiom on the medium of Sound,
the numerous ‘Experiments’ on Sound in Sylva Sylvarum, Centuries ii, iii ;
on the medium oi Heat, the numerous remarks scattered throughout this
Book oi the Novum Organum; and on the medium through which the
Magnet acts, the Inquisitio De Magnete (E. and S., vol ii. pp. 311-2), and
Νον. Org. ii. 42· His remarks on the transmission oi Heat are vitiated
throughout by his not distinguishing between radiation and conduction.

One oi the most important differences with respect to transmission
through media is that, while heat and light can be transmitted in vacuo,
sound cannot. Moreover, the denset the air in which a sound is gene-
rated, the more intense is it Α magnet will act in vacuo, but Faraday
has shown that a substance, which is paramagnetic in vacuo, may become ·
diamagnetic in air. As respects electricity, 1 may quote the following
passage from Ganot’s Physics (rath Ed. of Translation, ξ 927): ‘The
electrical discharge does not pass through a vacuum, as is shown by the
following experimere Α small tube containing caustic potash is fused to
a Geissler’s tube connected with a'Sprengel pump. By continual ex-
haustion while the caustic potash is being heated, as complete a vacuum
as possible is made ol the tube scaled. The last minute trace os aqueous
vapour is absorbed by the caustic potash as it cools. In this complete
vacuum the discharge, however strong, no longer passes; the vacuum
acts as a complete non-conductor!

³⁴ This somewhat lanciful notion, still more sanciiully illustrated, re·
quires no comment. Better illustrations would have been, in respect of
determining iunctions, the place oi the beart and brain in the animal
economy, or, in respect oi relative importance, that of the seed-vessels
in plante. For the metaphor, cp. Arist. Pol. i. 5 (6) : ἡμὲν γὰρ ψυχὴ τοῦ
σώματος ἄρχει δεσποτικὴν ἀρχήν, ὁ δὲ νοῦς nis ὀρέξεως πολιτικὴν mi βασιλικήν,
