Exempli gratia: sint naturae inquisitae quatuor naturae
illae, quas contubernales vult esse Telesiusffl, et tanquam ex
eadem eamera3 viz. calidum, lucidum, tenue, mobile sive
promptum ad motum. At plurimae inveniuntur instantiae
divortii inter ipsas. Aer enirn tenuis est et habilis ad motum,
non calidus aut lucidus; luna lucida, absque calore; aqua
fervens calida, absque lumine; motus acus ferreae super ver·
sorium pernix et agilis, et tamen in corpore frigido, denso,
opac03 et complura id genus.

Similiter sint naturae inquisitae Natura Corporea et Actio
Naturalis. Videtur enim non inveniri actio naturalis, nisi
subsistens in aliquo corpore. Attamen possit sortasse esse
circa hanc rem instantia nonnulla divortii. Ea est actio
magnetica, per quam serrum fertur ad magnetem, gravia ad
globum terraeffl. Addi etiarn possint aliae nonnullae opera-

³⁰ See Telesius, De Rerum Natura, passim ; especially lib. i. capp. 1, a.
Thus, oi the Suri, he says: ‘omnino calidus, tenuis, candidus, mobilisque
est Sol ε Terra contra, frigida, crassa, immobilis, tenebricosaque.’

³¹ Cp. last Aphorism‚ Example (3), where, on the other hand, he appears
undoubtedly to distinguish between magnetic attraction and the attraction
exercised by the earth. Possibly‚ in the present place, he may be using
the word ‘magnetic' only in a vague and general sense, as=attractive.
Notice the words ‘sive coitiva’ below.

liacon's idea appears to have been that magnetism and terrestrial attrac-
tion (which he here seems, at least, to speak oi as ii they were the same)
act without ail'ecting the interrnediate bodies (air, ether, or whatever they
may be); that they act in time ς and, hence, that ‘the natural action' or
‘virtue’ is, as it were, sor a while suspended between the acting body and
the body acted upon. From these circumstances he infers that ‘natural
action’ may be detached irorn any ‘corporeal nature!

The manner in which gravitation acts is still unknown. We know the
lact and the law, but all the rest is mere matter oi speculation. Whether
the sorce does or does not require a material medium sor its propagation,
and whether it is or is not transmitted in time, are questions which have
not yet been resolved and which, perhaps, admit oi no solution. lt was
calculated by Laplace that, is its velocity be measurable at all, lt must be,
at least, liity millions oi times greater than the velocity of light. As to the
medium, though there are grounds sor believing in the existence ol a subtle
and elastic ether pervading all space, there is no positive evidence ior
connecting with this medium the phenomena oi gravitation.

Similarly, there is no evidence to shew whether magnetic and electrical
attraction require time ior their transmissi0n‚ and a medium in which to act.
The velocity oi conducted electricity has been calculated, sorbarious media,
