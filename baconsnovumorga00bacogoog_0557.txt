interciperentur saepenumero, et confunderentur ³⁸. Atque de
mensuris temporum simplicibus haec dicta sint.

Verum non solum quaerenda est mensura motuum et actio·
num simpliciter, sed multo magis comparative: id enim eximii

est usus et ad plurima spectat. Atque videmus flammam ali-
cujus tormenti ignei citius cerni, quam sonitus audiatur ς licet
necesse sit pilam prius aerem percutere, quam flamma quae
pone erat exire potuerit; fieri hoc autem propter velociorem
transactionem motus lucis,quam soni. Videmus etiam species
visibiles a visu citius excipi quam dimitti 39; unde fit quod
nervi fidium, digito impulsi, duplicentur aut triplicentur quoad
speciem, quia species nova recipitur, antequam prior demit-
tatur⁴⁰; ex quo etiam fit, ut annuli rotati videantur globosi,
et fax ardens, noctu velociter portata, conspiciatur caudata
Etiam ex hoc fundamento inaequalitatis motuum quoad
velocitatem, excogitavit Galilaeus⁴¹ causam fluxus et refluxus

³⁸ l think that Bacon must here have in mind cosmical clouds, iu the
interstellar spaces‚ not ordinary or aerial clouds. The argument is that
the light of the stars, if it took a long time for its transmission, would be
frequently stupped by various obstacles in the sky, whereas, on a clear
night, we invariably see the stars where we expect to find them. At the
same time, it must be confessed that, if there were such obstades as 1 am ,¹
supposing Bacon to contemplate, the light might sometimes be interoepted, ¹
however instantaneous its transmission. There is, then, an undoubred κ
difficulty in the passage, though it does not appear to me so great as it J
seems to appear to Mr. Spedding. ,¹

³⁹ The retention of images on the retina of the eye is a familiar pheno ,l
menon, of which the reader will easily supply himself with instances. The
duration of the persistence varies with the intensity of the light and the
sensitiveness of the organ. ‘M. Plateau has investigated the duration of
the impression by numerous methods, and has found that it is on the
average half a second. e e s A great number of pieces of apparatus are
founded on the persistence of sensation on the retina. Such are the
thaumatrope‚ the phenakistoscope, Faraday’s wheel, the kaleidophone,
and the zoetrope.' Ganot’s Physics, 12th Ed, ξ 625.

⁴⁰ Mr. Ellis says that ‘in the case of vibrating strings Bacon's explana·
tion is not altogether complete. The distinctor quasi-distinct images to
which he refers correspond to limiting positione of the vibrating string!

⁴¹ ‘This account of Galileo's theory of the tides is inaccurate ln this
theory the tides are caused by the varying velocity of different points of
the earth's surface, arising from the composition of the earth’s two
motions‚ namely that about its axis, and that in its orbit Eacon does not
seem to have perceived that both these motions are essentia] to the
