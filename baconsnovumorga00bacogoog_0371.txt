Fttost the prelatory remarks of Book I, Bacon passes in Book ll toa
more formal and positive exposition of his method. The lirst ten Aphor-
isms consist mainly oi general reflexions, lor the most part very obscurely
worded, on the ends oi sciente, on the necessity oi enquiring into Forms,
and on the connexion between the speculative and practical branches oi
knowledge. He then proceeds to give a specimen ol the investigation ol
a Form, taking as his example the Fonn ol Heat. The first step in the
investigation is to draw up certain Tables, the ultimate purpose of which
is to enable him to eliminate those qualities which might be supposed to
be, but which are not really, ol the required Form. When the Tables
are completed, and the salse explanatione have, so far as possible, been
rejected, he proceeds, according to his own metaphor, to reap the ‘Vin-
demiatio Prima de sonna Calidi,’ and, in order to reap this vintage, he
gives free play to the Imagination, that is, in spite ol his warnings to
the contrary in Book I, he frames Hypotheses. This process is called
‘ permissio intellectus’ ‘Atque haec sit prima vindemiatio, sive inter·
pretatio inchoata de sonna Calidi, lacta per permissionem intellectus'
(see Aph. ιο). ln Aph. 21 he announces that, having completed the
‘Tabulae' and ‘Vindemiatio Prima,' he will proceed ‘ad reliqua auxilia
intellectus circa Interpretationem Naturae et Inductionem veram ac per-
lectam! Oi these ‘auxilia' he enumerates nine (Aph. τι), but os the
nine one only, the ‘Praerogativae lnstantiarum’ (ol which there are
twenty-seven varieties), is discussed in the' Fragment oi the Novum
Organum which Bacon published„ He is on the point ol passing on to
the ‘adminicula inductionis‚’ when the work abruptly ends.
