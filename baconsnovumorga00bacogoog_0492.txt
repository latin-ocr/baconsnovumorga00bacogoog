At si recipiatur opinio Gilbertitt, quod magnetica vis terrae

ultra), hocque per aliquam instantiam verificetur; ea demum

affect other things, or again which other things might seek'

lt seems strange that Baton did not perceive that the position which he
criticises would be quite in accordante with any interpretation which could
be put on the ‘sympathia sive consensus’ oi which he speaks below, and
that it would beno real exception to the mle ‘corpus non nisi a corpore

appetitus ascendendi et descendendi’ imply the notion oi positive levity.

⁸⁵ lt is curious here to notice how iar Bacon was from seeing that the
moon was exactly a case in point, or irom divining the true bond oi
connexion (¹ioederis sive unionis') between its revolution round the earth
and the phenomena oi lalling bodies.

⁶⁰ See De Magnete, lib. ii. cap. 7. The expression ‘orbis virtutis,’ as
applied both to the earth and to ordinary magnets‚ is common throughout
the book, and is defined, at the beginning, as ‘totum illud spatium, per
quod quaevis magnetis virtus extenditur!

The phenomena oi gravitation, it must be recollected, are explained by
Gilbert as cases oi magnetism.

⁶² Both this and the next case, Bacon conceived, would afford examples
ot' Instantiae Foederis, hy proving that heavy bodies, though left free, may
be at rest. They show how immature were his conceptione oi motion, as
well as oi gravity.

⁸⁹ On the phenomena oi Whirlwinds, Waterspouts, and Dust-Storms,
see Sir John Herschel’s Meteorology, pp. 241-7. Alter describing Whirl-
winds, he says: ‘They are osten terminated by heavy ialls oi rain, a very
obvious consequence oi the sudden transfer oi a great mass oi air nearly
saturated with vapour at the surlace ol the earth to a much higher level!
He then continues: ‘Whirlwiuds oi this kind taking place at sea give rise
to waterspouts (trombes de mer), which are very singular and sometimes
dangerous phenomena. Tall columns, apparently oi cloud, and reaching
from the sea to the clouds, are seen moving majestically along, osten
