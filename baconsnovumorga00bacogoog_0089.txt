The reader will find a good account ol ‘Form‘ in Mr. Ellis’s
General Preiace to the Philosophical Works ol Bacon, sect. 8. My
conclusions are in general accordance with his, though 1 have arrived
at them by a somewhat different route.

§9- τηε naraon or nxcuusrous.

Bacon evidently regarded this method as the corner-stone ol his
system ⁴¹. See, lor instance, Nox. Org. i. 69, 1053 ii. 15, 16,19.
To understand his meaning, these passages should be carelully
studied in connexion with each other as well as with the various
places where he speaks of the discovery ol Forms.

The complex substances and operations ol nature admitted, he
conceived, as we have already seen in the section on ‘FormS,' ol
being broken up into a lew ‘simple natures,' just as the numerous
words ol a language are composed of a small number of simple
sounds or letters. The lirst business ol seience‚ then, was to ascertain
the ‘ forms ' ol these simple natures. This work might, he supposed,
be eliected by means ol the ‘Method ol Exclusions.’ The number
ol ‘simple natures’ being limited, and, as he seems to have thought,
at least ultimately ascertainable, il we wish to find with what other
nature any given nature is invariably connected (this phrase is mine,
not his) either as an ellect or as a species, we have nothing to do
but to go on ascertaining with what natures it is not so connected.
And il we can succeed in excluding all but one, it follows that this
is the nature ol which we are in search. ‘Est itaque Inductionis
verae opus primum (quatenus ad inveniendas formas) rejectio sive
exclusiva naturarum singularum, quae non inveniuntur in aliqua
instantia, ubi natura data adest; aut inveniuntur in aliqua instantia,

⁴2 Mt. Ellis refers to a curione aad apt passage in the exposition ol the Fable ol
Cupid (De Principiis atque Originibus, E. aud S, vol. iii. pp. 81, 82): ‘quue a
parabola ipsa monemur, ubl eleganter fingitur Cupido, ovum Nocte incubante ex·
clusum. * * * *Aptissime autem refertar illud de ovo Noctis ad demonstrationes
per quas Cupido iste ln lucem editur. Quae enim per affirmativas concluduntur,
videntur panus lucis; quae vero per negativas et exclusiones, ea tanquam a tene·
bris et nocte exprimuntur et educuntur. Est autem iste Cupido vere ovum
exclusum a Nocte; notitia enim ejus (quae omuino haberi potest) procedit per
exclusiones et negativas’
