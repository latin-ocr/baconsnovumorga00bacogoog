amus adhuc bonas et veras notiones ⁹⁶ naturarum simplicium,
quomodo rectificari potest exclusivo? At nonnullae ex
supradictis (veluti notio naturae elementaris, notio naturae
coelestis, notio tenuitatis) sunt notiones vagae, nec bene

terminatae. ltaque nos, qui nec ignari sumus nec obliti
quantum opus aggrediamur (viz. ut faciamus intellectum
humanum rebus et naturae parem), nullo modo acquiescimus
in his, quae adhuc praecepimus: sed et rem in ulterius
provehimus, et fortiora auxilia in usum intellectus machi-
namur et ministramus3 quae nunc subjungemus. Et certe in
interpretatione naturae animus omnino taliter est praeparandus
et formandus, ut et sustineat se in gradibus debitis certitudinis,
et tamen cogitet (praesertim sub initiis) ea quae adsunt
multum pendere ex iis quae supersunt.

Attamen quia citius emergit veritas ex errore quam ex

⁹⁶ But these notions are themselves to be gained by Induction. See
Bk. i. Aphs. 14, 18, 40. The fact is that true axioms and sound notious ¹
are interdependeot and imply each other. ln Mathematics, the work of
defiuition is elementary and comparatively easy, but, in the Physical and
Moral Sciences, we must already have made considerable advances, before
we can begin to define with any precision. Cp. note 99 on i. 59. Our
notions become clearer as we ascertain more facts, and, as our notions
become clearer, the facts we‘collect or infer become more pertinent and
more pregnant. Hence, 1 arn inclined to think that Bacon did not con·
template two distinct kinds of indoctior, one for the clearing up of
conceptione and another for the establishmeut of ardonis. Mr. Ellis,
however (see General Preface, vol. i. p. 37), is apparently of a different
opinion.

⁹⁰ llere Bacon advocates the employment of hypothesis, notwithstand-
ing his implied condemnatiou of it in the First Book. See i. 19, and my
note upon it. His remark at the beginning of the present Aphorism is
conceived in a far truer and more scientific spirit than the language which
(unless we except that of i. 106, q. v.) he has hitherto employed on the
subject. To repeat what l have said elsewhere: ‘Even though a hypo·
thesis may ultimately be discovered to be false, it may be of great service
in pointing the way to a truer theory. Thus the circular theory of
planetary motion, and the supplementary theory of epicycles and eccen-
trics, undoubtedly contributed to the formation of the hypothesis which
was eventually proved to be true. Kepler himself tried no less than
niueteen different hypotheses, before he hit upon the right one, and his
