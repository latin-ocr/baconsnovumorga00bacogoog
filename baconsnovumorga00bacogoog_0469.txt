'⁶ lt is true that the higher we ascend in the atmosphere, the colder it
is, and the lower we descend into the interior oi the earth, the warmer
it is; but these two sets ot facts depend on different musas, and hence
they do not really constitute an Instantia Conionnis

quakes, see Lyell's Principles of Geology, chs. on the Causes oi Earth·
quakes and Volcanoes (rath Ed, chs. 32, 33).

⁸⁶ Cp. ii. 12. lust. 24 The word ἀντιπερίστασις is oi not uncommon
occurrence in Aristotle. See, for instance, Physica, viii. ιο (p. 267 a 16):
διὸ καὶ r'v ἀέρι καὶ e'r ὕδατι γίνεται ἡτοιαύτη κίνησις, ἣν λέγουσι’ τινες ‹irrr-
nrpiarnow εἶναι. Meteorologlca, ἰ. 12 (p. 348 b. 2) : ἀλλ’ ἐπειδὴ ὁρῶμεν ὅτι
γίνεται dvrtnrpiarnars τῷ θερμῷ καὶ τῷ ψυχρῷ ἀλλήλοις. On the former
passage, Bonita quotes the following definition from Simplicius: dm·
nepiarnais ἐστιν, ὅταν ἐξωθουμένου τινὸς σώματος ἀπαλλαγὴ γένηται τῶν
τόπων, καὶ τὸ pir ἔξωθῆσαν r’r τῷ τοῦ ἔξωθηθέντος στῇ remp, τὸ δ’ ἐξωθηθέν rrl
προσεχὲς ἐξωθῇ, ἕως ἃν rd ἔσχατον ἐν τῷ τόπῳ γένηται τοῦ πρώτου ἐξωθῆσαντος.

⁰⁷ Tbese are the ‘Axiomata quae particularium scientiarum non sint
propria, sed pluribus earum in commune competant' which constitute one
division oi the Philosophia Prima. See De Augmentis‚ iii. r. Aristotle
employs the word ἀξιώματα in a similar, though not exactly the same
sense, for the principles or pre-suppositions common to all sciences. See
note on i. 7. Α still nearer parallel would be the ‘mathematical axioms‚'
so iar as they are common to the sciences oi arithmetic and geometry.

⁹⁸ ‘Is not the trope oi music, to avoid or slide from the close or cadenoe‚
common with the trope oi rhetoric oi deceiving expectation i’ Advance-
ment oi Learning, bk. ii. (E. and S., vol. iii. pp. 348-9). ‘Tropus ille
Musicus, a clausula aut cadentia (quam vocant), curn jamjam adesse
videatur, placide elabendi, convenit cum tropo Rhetorico expectationem
eludendi! De Augrn. iii. 1. The following note, communicated by
Professor Sir F. A. Gore Ouseley,l borrow from Dr. Kitchin: ‘At first
l thought it meant a “Cadenza d’ lnganno‚’' or “lalse cadence;'¹ but l
have now satisfied mysels that such a thing was unlmown in Bacon’s
time. lam rather inclined to think it reiers to a species oi salse close,
such as we find in the last bar but two oi Tallis's Nunc dimittis in D,

where the Hannony proceeds to ξ and ,ζ on Α sor a Bass, as though

it were about to close immediately on the chord of D; when suddenly
the Tenor strikes a Cn, which necessitates a modulation into the chord
os G, thus leading to a “ Plagal Close.”’
