most successful, perhaps the only successful, part of Liebig’s attack on
Baoon is directed against this class of his writings

On the supreme importance attached hy Bacon to the collection of
observations and experimenta which it was his intention to make, see
Mr. Spedding's Preface to the Parasceve, given in vol. i. of the Collected
Works, pp. 369-390. 1 cannot, however, but think that Mr. Spedding
- slightly exaggeratos the importance which Bacon attached to this pan of
his reform. Surely ‘the novelty, from which the most important results
were to be expected,’ if we are to select any one part of the scheme as
such, was his Inductive Method. ‘Spes est una in inductione vera' ‘ln
hac cene inductione' (namely, induction as reformed by himself) ‘spes
maxima sita est!

lt may be remarlred, however, as a proof of the great importance which
Bacon attached to his Natural History, that, when he published the N ovum
Organum in its fragmentary form, passing over all the ‘auxilia intellectua’
(see lib. ii. Aph. 21) between the first and eighth, he thought it desirable
to append an account of the latter, as fumishing a description of the plan
on which his Natural History was to be constructed. The title of this
Appendix is ‘ Parasceve ad Historiam Naturalem et Expenmentalem’ or
‘Descriptio Historiae Naturalis et Experimentalis, Qualis sufficiat et sit in
ordine ad Basia et Fundamenta Philosophiae Verae! It is followed by a
‘Catalogus Historiarum Particularium,’ on which he designed, at his
leisure, to draw up a list of questions, illustrating the true method of en·
quiry. We are informed, moreover, by Dr. Rawley that the Sylva Sylva·
rum was the last work on which Bacon was engaged. ln that case, he
must have suspended the composition of the Novum Organum, in order to
carry on his Natural History.
