50 INTRODUCTION.

oppositione which are not3 and put them into new terms so fixed, as
whereas the meaning ought to govem the term, the term in eisect
governeth the meaning ²⁶! A man so acute as Bacon could not
help seeing thus iar, but hi's indifference, Ithinlr, extended iar beyond
the range ο1 these mere verbal quibbles and scholastic combats. His
indifference was not simply an indifference ol the head ς it was an
indifference of the heart. What he really cared for was the advance-
meritos science, the knowledge oi nature, the extension oi the king-
domos man ¹⁷. He did not repudiate religion, or even theology;
rather, he was a respectiul, though silent, worshipper; but, like
many another man, he entered the shrine only on occasion, while,
at most times, his business lay iar away. There was, perhaps,
a latent feeling that not much knowledge was to be had in these
subjects, numerous and eager as were the workmen engaged in
attempting to extract it3 while, in the wide field ο1 nature, the
harvest was ready, though the labourers were few. And so Bacon
contented himself with working in what appeared to him the more
promising field ο1 labour. He sought God in nature, and there he
recognised, reverenced, and adorcd Him. The same God was also
to be iound in the arlr of the Church, and the pages ο1 the Bible 3
but Bacon’s tastes and pursuits lay another way, and hence, though
he had no inclination to call in question the leading verities of saith,
he received them, always without enthusiasm, 3ηά sometimes, even,
with apparent indifference.

yth. This last consideration may aiiord some explanation oi the
two other points to which I shall call attention. One of these is
the evident preference which Bacon accords to Atheism over Super-
stition. ‘It were better to have no opinion of God at all, than such
an opinion as is unworthy ο1 him. For the one is unbeliei, the
other is contumely: and certainly superstition is the reproach ο1
the Deity. Plutarch saith well to that purpose: Surely (saith he)I
had rather a great deal men should say there roas no such man at all
as Plutarch, than that they should say that there was one Plutarch that
would 331 his children assoon as they were born ,· as the poets speak
ο1 Saturn. And as the contumely is greater towards God, so the
danger is greater towards men. Atheism leaves a man to sense, to
philosophy, to natural piety, to laws, to reputation ; all which may
