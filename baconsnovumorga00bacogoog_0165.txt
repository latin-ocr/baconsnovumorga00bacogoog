perhaps, did he like Bacon personally; sor (p. 226) ‘Dr Harvey told
me his eie was like the eie 01 a viper.¹ Be this as it may, the opinion
was not an unnatural nor altogether an unlair one, as expressed by a
man 01 great eminence, in a particular branch 01 science, concerning
one who attempted to make all science his province. Then as now,
Ipresume,the philosopherandthe specialist were apt to misunderstand
and undervalue each other.

Mr. Napier refers to a work 01 Alexander Ross, a voluminous
author, well known to the readers 01 Hudibras, entitled Arcana
Microcosmi, or the Hid Secrets os Man's Body discovered3 with a
Relutation, amongst other books, 01 ‘Lord Bacon’s Natural History,'
1652. (The copy in the Bodleian is the Ed. 01 1651, containing only
the refutation 01 Dr. Browne’s Vulgar Errors, and not that 01 Bacon’s
Sylva Sylvarum.) The author says: ‘I have cursorily run over my
Lord’s New Philosophy,' and ‘lind that philosophy is like wine, the
older the better to the taste.³ He is specially angry with ‘these new
Philosophers' sor having ‘jumbled the predicamenta so together,

in the wild desan! ‘Let Prodigals lorsake their husks‚ and leave
them to swine'

In Francis Osbom's Miscellany (1659), The Author to the Reader,
there is a curious sentence, shewing how early the charge 01 Atheism
was directed against Bacon. Alter speaking 01 Raleigh having been
branded with the title 01 an Atheist, ‘though aknown asserter os God
and providence,’ the writer goes on to say: ‘A like censure sell to the
share 01 venerable Bacon‚ till over-balanced hya greater weight 01
glory 110111 Strangers’

Cudworth‚ in his Intellectual System (published in 1678), attacks'
Bacon 101 having called in question the received doctrine os F inal
Causea. He seems doubtful, however, what interpretation to put on
his words. Thus, having spoken 01 ‘some who have unskilfully
attributed their own Properties to Inanimate Bodies,’ he proceeds to
say: ‘Os which F ancisul Extravagances 11 the Advancer 01 Leaming
