94 INTRODUCTION.

goes on, however, to say that the appeal to experience was in itself
by no means sufficient to conduct them to truth. ‘Quid igitur? Num
veritatis compotes isti? Nihilo minus? And, towards the end of the
treatise (p. 539), he adds: ‘Ego vero (fili), si te jamjam animo ab
idolis non repurgato vertiginosis experientiae ambagibus committerem,
nae tu ducem cito desiderares.¹ Paracelsus (as Ι have elsewhere
noticed) is specially emphatic in his reJection of authority.

De Remusat (pp. 388-390)‚ following De Gerando, bestows what
appears to me the most exaggerated praise on a small work, published
at Basle in 1558, by Acontio or Contio, entitled ‘De Methodo sive
recta investigandarum tradendarumque artium ac scientiarum ratione!
It seems to me ridiculous to insinuate, as De Remusat appears to do,
that Bacon was under special obligations to a work, from which, in·
deed, there was little to borrow. The book is, for the time at which it
was written, a clear and useful little treatise on the practical applica·
tions of Logic to study and teaching, but it discusses the four causes,
definition, division, and the like, rather than induction and the kindred
topics of observation, experiment, &c The only part of it which
admits of comparison with the Novum Organum is pp. 75—78,
Leyden Ed, 1617. Speaking of Division, he says that, before we
divide, we ought to know ‘toturn ipsum, quod dividendum sit.
Quamobrem, si forte in promptu non sit, indagare illud opportebit ab
aliquorum singularium inspectione! He then shews how we may
arrive at a knowledge of the whole from an examination of particular
instances, ‘abstrahendo semper illa universa a singularibus? He
proceeds to say that the likenesses of diverse things are the means
by which we arrive at our knowledge of the whole: ‘quamobrem
perscrutari illam similitudinem quam diligentissime in rebus dissimi-
libus necesse est! But, surely, this has been a common-place of
logicians from the days of Socrates and Plato downwards.

The principal object of this work seems to be to recommend the
‘methodus resolutiva’ or analytic method, the method of working
backwards from the effect to the cause, or the end to the means,
in preference to the ‘methodus compositiva¹ or synthetic method.

·. Telesio (1509-1588), whom he himself calls the ‘best of the
novellists,’ Bacon had no doubt read with great care, and in this
author‘s works he could not fail to notice the attacks on Aristotle
(referred to in the last section) and the constant appeals to sense
and experience. The very title of the first of Telesius’ nine books
‘De Rerum Natura’ is sufficient to shew the spirit in which he
writes: ‘Mundi Constructionem, Corporumque in eo Contentorum
