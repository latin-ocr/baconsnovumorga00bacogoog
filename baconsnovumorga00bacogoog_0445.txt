bent naturam, de qua fit inquisitio, in talibus subjectis quae
nil habent commune cum aliis subjectis, praeter illam ipsam
naturam3 aut rursus quae non exhibent naturam, de qua fit
inquisitio, in talibus subjectis quae sunt similia per omnia cum
aliis subjectis, praeterquam in illa ipsa natura. Manifestum
enim est quod hujusmodi instantiae tollant ambages, atque
accelerent et roborent exclusivum ³⁵,· adeo ut paucae ex illis
sint instar multarum.

Exempli gratia: si fiat inquisitio de natura Celeris ³⁶, In-
stantiae Solitariae sunt prismata, gemmae chrystallinae, quae
reddunt colores non solum in se sed exterius supra parietem,
item rores, &c Istae enim nil habent commune cum coloribus
' fixis in floribus, gemmis coloratis, metallis, lignis, dre, praeter
ipsum colorem. Unde facile colligitur, quod color nil aliud
sit quam modificatio imaginis lucis immissae et receptae: in
priore genere, per gradus diversos incidentiae; in posteriore,
per texturas et schematismos varios corporis. Istae autem
Instantiae sunt solitariae quatenus ad similitudinem ³⁷.

Rursus in eadem inquisitione, venae distinctae albi et nigri
in marmoribus, et variegationes colorum in floribus ejusdem

the various instances compared (for here we generally require more than
two instances) agree in nothing, except in the possession oi two circum«

stances which are common to all the instances! Here, of course, the '

‘two circumstances ’ arethe ‘natura de qua fit inquisitio’ and the assigned
cause. The cogency of these methods is almost evident from the state-
ment of them. ‘The Method of Agreement,' says Mr. Mill, ‘stands on
the ground that whatever ean be eliminated, is not connected with the
phenomenon byanylaw. The Method oi Difference has for its foundation
that whatever can nothe eliminated, r'r connected with the phenomenon
byalaw.'

⁸³ The second division, answering to the Method of Differeuce, does
more than this. lf its conditions were perfectly satisfied, it would demon·
strate the truth oi the assigned cause.

³⁶ Bacon is no less happy in his example than iubis rule. ‘He con-
eludes,¹ says Professor Playiair, ‘that colour is nothing else than a modi-
fication of the rays of light, produced, in the first case, by the different
degrees of incideuee; and, in the second, by the texture or constitution of
the suriaces of bodies. He may be considered as very fortunate in fixing
on these examples 3 for it was by means of them that N ewton afterwards
found out the composition oi light!

⁸² it will be noticed that the very expressions ‘Method ongreemeut'
and ⁴ Metbod oi Difference' all but occur in the Text.
