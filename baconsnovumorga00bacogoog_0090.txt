METHOD OF EXCLUSIONS. 61

ubi natura data abest; aut inveniuntur in aliqua instantia crescere,
cum natura data decrescat3 aut decrescere, cunr natura data crescat.
Tumvero post rejectionem et exclusivamdebitismodis factam, secundo
loco (tanquam infundo) manebit (abeuntibus in fumum opinionibus
volatilibus) forma affirmativa, solida, et vera, et bene terminata ⁴³3 In
the present state of knowledge, however, he does not seem to think
this ideal attainable. ‘Neque vero ipsa exclusiva ullo modo perfecta
est, neque adeo esse potest sub initiis’ (ii. 19). Hence the necessity
not only of the ‘Tables' but also of the ‘praerogativae instantiarum’
and other ‘aids of the intelleet,’ in order to complete, as far as
may be, the ‘Exclusiva3' as well asos some method of clearing up
our conceptions of the ‘simple natures' (which method he like-
wise regarded as inductive, though he says nothing further about it ⁴⁴.
See i. 14, 18). ⁶ Itaque nos, qui nec ignari sumus, nec obliti, quantum
opus aggrediamur (via ut faciamus intellectum humanum rebus et
naturae parem), nullo modo acquiescimus in his, quae adhuc prae
cepimus: sed et rem in ulterius provehimus, et fortiora auxilia in
usum intellectus machinamur ct ministramus; quae nunc subjun-
gemus ⁴⁵3

Now, perhaps, the first remark that occurs to one in considering
this method is that it seems to be assumed that every ‘simple nature’
has some other ‘simple nature’ which is its form, or part of its form.
Thus, heat, which is itselfa simple nature, is a species of motion, or,
to put the same thing in different words, an effect of motion. Some
of the ‘simple natures,’ then, are genera or causes of the other
simple natures. But, if so, there must evidently be some one or
more of the ‘simple natures' which cannot be brought under any
genus or cause. This or these, then, have no ‘form “.’

Another remark, already made by Mr. Ellis ⁴⁷, is that of the two
concomitant natures, or, as Ι have put it, of the two natures

⁴¹ 1 am inclined to think that Bacon supposed the work oi clearing up our con-
oeptions and that of establishing true axioms would prooeed pari passu, though
lllr. Ellis (General Prelaee, p. 37) is apparently ol a different opinion. See my note
onii. 19.

⁴⁸ This, perhaps, may have been the reason why Bacon, in writing the second
book of the Novum Organnm, changed his example from Motion to Heat. It
would have been found very difficult to assign the ‘form' of Molion. For this
earlier example ol his method, ‘F ilum labyrinthi, sive Inquisitio Legitima de
Motn,' see Ellis and Spedding, vol. iii. pp. 621-640.
