natura' must not be taken as implying that he thought the old method
sufficient for the moral and political sciences. See note on Aphorism 29.

The contrast which Bacon here draws between himself and the philo-
sophers of the New Academy can hardly fail to remind us of the similar
contrast which has frequently been drawn between Socrates and the
leading Sophists of his time. The method of Socrates began in scepticism,
but its object was to reestablish the foundations of knowledge. Similarly,
Bacon attempts to destroy the credit of the old method of enquiry, only
that he may replace it by a new and surer one. There is a passage in
the Advancement of Learning (bk. i.) in which he says, if not truly‚ at least
finely: ‘if a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but
if he will be content to begin with doubts (‘eaque aliquandiu patienter
toleret! De Augmentis), he shall end in certainties.'

⁴⁸ Here commences the doctrine of the Idola, which is, perhaps, the
best-known, as it is, certainly, one of the most important parts of the
Novum Organum. On the meaning of the word ‘Idola,’ see the first
note on Aph 23. Mr. Ellis draws attention to the various forms in
which this doctrine appears in Bacon’s different works‚ buta still more
accurate and elaborate account of the changes is given in a note by
Mr. Spedding. See Ellis and Spedding’s Bacon, vol. i. pp. 89—93, and
Note C (by Mr. Spedding), pp. 113-117. To these sources the reader
who may wish for more information on the subject is referred. lt is
sufficient here to state that the ldols in their earlier form (as they appear
in the English Treatise on the Advancement of Leaming) correspond with
those of tlte Tribe‚ the Cave, and the Market·Place‚ and that ‘the one
substantial change which the doctrine of ldols underwent was the admis-
sion of the ldola Theatri into the company! ΤῙιε doctrine occurs in the
Valerius Terminus, the Advancement of Leaming, the Temporis Partus
Masculus, the Partis Secundae Delineatio, the Distributio Operis, and the
De Augmentis, but far the most perfect treatment of it is that in the
Novum Organum. On the classification of the ldola into groups l shall
say something in a note on the next Aphorism.

lt has often been remarked that the doctrine of the Idola was anti-
cipated by Bacon's great namesake, Roger Bacon, who gives a four-fold
classification of ‘offendicula quae omnem quemcunque sapientem im·
pediunt.’ These are unworthy authority, custom, vulgar opinion, and
concealment of ignoranee combined with the ostentation of apparent
wisdom. Mr. Ellis, however (vol. i. pp. 89, 90), argues very justly that
Bacon is not likely to have seen the Opus Majus, which then existed only
in manuscript, and, as Mr. Spedding adds, was probably not procurable,
and possibly even unknown to him ; rnoreover, the correspondence between
