434 NOVUM ORGANUM.

sive Similitudines Physicas, appellare consuevimus Eae
vero sunt, quae ostendunt similitudines et conjugationes
rerum, non in formis minoribus (quod faciunt instantiae con·
stitutiuae) sed plane in concreto ⁸⁰. Itaque sunt tanquam .
primi et infimi gradus ad unionem naturae. Neque constituunt
aliquod axioma statim ab initio, sed indicant et observant
tantum quendam consensum corporum ⁸¹. Attamen licet non
multum promoveant ad inveniendas formas, nihilominus magna
cum utilitate revelant partium universi fabricam, et in membris
ejus exercent veluti anatomiam quandam ; atque proinde

similarity, some very remarkable differences in the substances which they
contain, the trap rocks containing calcareous epar, and the lava never
containing any. On the supposition that they are both oi igneous origin,
is there any circumstance, in the conditions in which beat may have been
applied to them, which can account for this differente? Sir James Hali,
in a train of most philosophical and happily·contrived experiments, has
explained the nature ol those conditione, and bas shown th'at the presence
os calcareous epar, or the want ot it, may arise lrom the greater or less
compression under which the fusion ol the basalt was performed. This
has served to explain a great difficulty in the history ol the mineral
kingdom.

‘Comparative anatomy is tull ol analogias ol this kind, which are most
instructive and uselul guides to discovery. lt was by remarking in the
blood-vessels a contrivance similar to the valves used in hydraulic engines,
for preventing the counter-current ol a fluid, that Harvey was led to the
discovery ot the circulation ol the blood. The analogies between natural
and artificial productioris are always highly deserving oi notice.¹ Pre-
liminary Dissertation.

It is by the bold use ol analogies oi this kind that modern physicists
have been able to trace the correlations oi the various physical sorces;
that modern philologists have been able to refer to the same families,
languages ol apparently the most dissimilar character; and that modern
jurists and moralists have detected in laws, institutions, customs, and
ieelings amongst the most widely scattered taces and at the most various
stages ol civilisation a common origin and a common meaning. Though
the strict use oi logical method is indispensable to demonstration and
verification, it is the observation ol analogies, and those olten very re·
mote ones, that generally sets us on the track ol great discoveries

⁶⁰ Tbat is, they are concemed with individual observations, and not
with inductive generalisations, as are the Instantiae constitutivae.

⁸¹ They serve to suggest axioms, rather than to establisb them See
note 79. lt is curious that consideratione of this kind did not lead Bacon
to attach greater importance to the office oi the Imagination in scientific
discovery.
