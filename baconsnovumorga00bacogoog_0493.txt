464 NOVUM ORGANUM.

in navigationibus per Oceanum Atlanticum versus Indias
utrasque saepe conspiciuntur. Tanta enim videtur esse vis
· et moles aquamm quae per hujusmodi cataractas subito
effunditur, ut videatur collectio aquarum fuisse ante sacta,
atque in his locis haesisse et mansisse; et postea potius per
causam violentam dejecta et detrusa esse, quarn naturali motu
gravitatis cecidisse; adeo ut conjici possit, corpoream molem
densam atque compactam in magna distantia a terra sore
pensilem tanquam terram ipsam, nec casuram nisi dejiciatur.
Verum de hoc nil certi affirmamus. Interim in hoc et iu
multis aliis sacile apparebit, quarn inopes simus historiae
naturalis; cum loco instantiarum certarum nonnunquam
suppositiones afferre pro exemplis cogamur.

Similiter sit natura inquisita Discursus ingenii. Videtur
omnino divisio vera, rationis humanae et solertiae brutorum.
Attamen sunt nonnullae instantiae actionum quae eduntur a
brutis, per quas videntur etiam bruta quasi syllogizare ⁶⁹: ut
memoriae proditum est de corvo, qui per magnas siccitates
sere enectus siti conspexit aquam in trunco cavo arboris ⁷⁰3

several at once, sometimes straight and vertical, at others inclined and

tortuous, but always, when approached, perceived to be in rapid rotation.
ht their bases the sea is violently agitated, and heaped up with a leaping
or boiling motion. lndeed‚ water would seem, at least in some cases, to
be actually carried up in considerable quantity, and scattered round from
a great height, as solid bodies are on land. Hence they have been
supposed by some to draw water irum the sea by suction, athing obviously
impossible.¹

It is needless to point out how crude is both Bacon’s account and his
explanation oi these phenomena.

⁸⁹ The observations and speculatione of Mr. Darwin, Mr. Herbert
Spencer, and others, have placed in an entirely new light the comparative
psychology oi man and the brute animals, and shown that here, as in the
rest oi nature, there is much less of discontinuity than was formerly
imagined. ln this, as in so many other places, Bacon seems to anticipato
modern theories.

²⁰ ln Sir Roger L’Estrange’s Collection of F ables, under the head os
Avianus' F ables, this story is told os ‘A Crow and a Pitcher‚' and the
moral drawn is, ‘There is a Natural Logiclr in Animals, over and above
the Instinct oi their kinds! In Mr. Robinson Ellis' Edition ol the F ables
oi Avianus, this Fable occurs as N o. XXVII.
