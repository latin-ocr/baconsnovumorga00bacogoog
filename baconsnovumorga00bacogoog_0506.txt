(3) Similiter, sit natura inquisita Pondus sive Grave ⁹⁹
Bivium circa hanc naturam tale est. Necesse est ut gravia
et ponderosa vel tendant ex natura sua ad centrum terrae,
per proprium schematismum3 vel ut a massa corporea ipsius
' terrae, tanquam a congregatione corporum connaturalium,
attrahantur et rapiantur, et ad eam per consensum ferantur.
At posterius hoc si in causa sit, sequitur ut quo propius gravia
appropinquant ad terram, eo fortius et majore cum impetu
ferantur ad eam; quo longius ab ea absint, debilius et tardius
(ut fit in attractionibus magneticis); idque fieri intra spatium
certum; adeo ut si elongata fuerint a terra tali distantia ut
virtus terrae in ea agere non possit, pensilia mansura sint, ut
et ipsa terra, nec omnino decasura.

Itaque talis circa hanc rem poterit esse instantia crucis.
Sumatur horologium¹ ex iis quae moventur per pondera plurn-

the apparent diurnal motion of the heavens from E. to W, so that it might
visibly move in the opposite direction to the heavens. This discovery, it
appears, would have convinced him that there is a motion of rotation from
W. to E, and that this motion, which he regarded as feigned simply for
the purpose of facilitating the calculations of astronomers (‘res conficta et
supposita’ dre), is not merely a modification of the diumal motion. lf no
such instance can be found, then, he says, we must continue to suspect
the theory, till we can find some other crucial instance to settle the
question.

⁹⁹ This paragraph does great credit to Bacon's sagacity, and isone of
those which give him a claim to be regarded as a pioneer of science as well
as a reformet of method. ‘Voltaire,' says Mr. Ellis, ‘cites the passage in
the text in support of his remark that “ le plus grand service, peut-ttre, qne
F. Bacon ait rendu a la philosophie a ete de deviner l'attraction.” But in
reality the notion of attraction in one form or other (e. g. the attraction of
the sea by the moon) sprang up in the infancy of physical speculation;
and it cannot be affirmed that Bacon’s ideas on the subject were as clear
as those of his predecessorWilliam Gilbert.¹ This criticism, l think, does
Baton scant justice. Even if the idea was suggested to him by the worlr
of Gilbert, he ought, at least, to obtain the credit of having detacbed the
conception of attraction from that of magnetism Cp, however, p.488,n. 31.
