ΗΒ. II. 48. 563

perpetuo trepidant, et irrequiete se agant ⁶⁴, ncc statu suo
contenta, nec ulterius ausa progredi. Talis invenitur motus
in corde et pulsibus animalium; et necesse est ut sit in
omnibus corporibus, quae statu ancipiti ita degunt inter
commoda et incommodant distracta liberare se tentent, et
denuo repulsam patiantur, et tamen perpetuo experiantur ⁰⁶.
(19) Sit Motus Decimus Nonus et postremus, motus ille cui
vix nomen motus competit, et tamen est plane motus. Quem
motum, Motum Decubitus ⁰⁶, sive Motum Exterrentiae Motus,
vocare licet. Per hunc motum terra stat mole sua⁰⁷, mo·
ventibus se extremis suis in medium; non ad centrum

⁸⁴ The word ‘agant,' which occurs in the First Edition, should be
replaced by ‘agrmt‚' as is done in the Second and Third Editions.

‘⁵ Cp. Historia Densi et Rari, E. and S, vol. ii. p. 263 : ‘Pulsus cordis
et arteriarum in animalibus fit per irrequietam dilatationem spirituum, et
receptum ipsorum, per vices! ln reading vague and sanciiul passages like
these, we must recollect that Harvey did not begin to teach his theory ol
the circulation oi the blood till 1619, and that it was not till 1628 that his
great treatise, the ‘Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in
Animalibus,’ was published. Bacon might, it is true, have derived more
precise views than those which he expresses from earlier writers, but there
was nothing specially to direct his attention to this subject.

The Tides and the astronomica] phenomena of Nutation and Libration
might furnish appropriate instances oi the ‘Motus Trepidationis!

⁸⁶ Decubitus=lying away from, sc motion. See Facciolati on decubo.'
He quotes Fabius Pictor apud Aul. Gell. lib. x. cap. 15: ‘Pedes lecti, in
quo cubat [sc. Flamen Dialis], luto tenui circumlitos esse oportet: et de
coiecto trinoctium continuum non decubat: neque in eo lecto cubare
alium fas est! Decubitus might, however, simply mean ‘lying down,'
‘reclining,’ ‘repose’ (Cp. decumbo.)

On Bacon's vague and improper use ol the word ‘motion,’ see the first
note on this Aphorism. Here it cannot be rendered even by ‘process' or
‘operation,’ hut we must reson to some word of very wide meaning, such
as ‘tendeney' or ‘affection' of matter.

‘laertia’ the property of which Bacon here speaks, is simply the inca·
pacity ol matter to change its own state oi rest or motion. The obscure
notions oi Bacon and his contemporaries about motion prevented them
from seeing that this property applies as much to the tendency oi a body
in motion to go on moving as to that of a body at rest to remain at rest.
For a briel account oi the establishment of the F irst Law oi Motion (which
seems to have been first enunciated by Galileo in 1638), see Whewell's
History oi the Inductive Sciences, vol. ii. bk. vi. ch. 2.

⁸⁷ Bacon seems never weary oi parading his belief in the immobility oi
the earth.
