116 INTRODUCTION.

Societies, and have so largely contributed their aydes to advance the
lord Bacon's Design for the Instauration os Arts and Sciences, that
it is now become above my abilities,' &c³¹
Boyle, who was himself called a Second Bacon, and who lent
Ι his rooms sor the meetings oi the Royal Society during the
latter part of its Oxsord career, is constant in his allusions to ‘our
illustribus Verulam,' ‘that proiound naturalist the Lord Verulam,’ ‘so
judicious asriend to philosophy and mankind, as Sir Francis Bacou,'
‘our famous experimenter, the Lord Verulam himsell' dre, &c.³‘·'

See his works, passim. Indeed Boyle seems to have been regarded,
in a special sense, as a disciple oi Bacon, In a letter to him, quoted

by Mr. Napier, from Dr. Beal, who was himself elected to the Royal
Society in 1662, the writer says: ‘You have particularized, explicated,
anderemplilied those sair encouragements and affectionate directions,
which Lcrd Bacon in awide generality proposed! Dr. Beal's letters³³‚
which are somewhat lengthy, are rull os allusions to Bacon, Thus,
he speaks of Boyle as ‘relieving Iord Bacon’s Sylva, and his Novum
Organum, which oli-times want your aid,' andin another letter, there
is a passage bearing on the connexion between Bacon's designs and
the establishment os the Royal Society: ‘And let me say to you,
that il you give these things in charge amongst your acquaintance,
that each man in his way may add to the search os others, then you
do fully prosecute the Verulamian design ; then our labour is joined

³¹ lt may here be notioed that Mr. Napier quotes Biichuer, whose work I have
not been ableto see, as referring the foundation ol learned societies throughout
Europe to the influeuce of Bacon: ‘Sed‚ quae superest dicenda, supremam, et, ut
uobis videtur, proximam condendae Academiae enarrabimus occasionem. Scilicet
postquam, ineunte circiter priori saeculo. uon inter Britannos solum, sed uniuersi

³² And yet Srr David Brewsler, ιιι his Lite of Newtou (.ch 27. vol.'' ιι. p. 403 os
rst Ed), says that‘ the amiable aud indefatigable Boyle( treated Bacon with the
same disrespectr'ul silence' that Newtou did. The silence oi Newton 1 shall discnss
presently.

³³ These are published amongst the letters from Several Persona to llr. Boyle,
iu the last volume ol Boyle’s Collected Wcrks.
