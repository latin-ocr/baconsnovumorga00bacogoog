BACON'S INFLUENCE ΟΝ PHILOSOPHY, 99

pean philosophy, in general, has been profoundly influenced by the r
method and speculations of Bacon. The main principle of lockc’s i
Essay, namely that all our ideas arc derived from either sensation or
reflexion, appears to me to be contained in germ in the rst Aphorisnt
of the Novum Organum, while to the attentive reader there can be
no doubt that his whole mode of treating psychological questions is
thoroughly imbued with the spirit of Bacon’s method It is true that
Locke never mentions Bacon expressly in the Essay¹⁴, but, as I shall
point out hereaster, the frequent citation of authors' names was not
a fashion of that time. Though the whole of the work might not im·
properly be regarded as apolemic against the philosophy of Descartes,
it is only very seldom that Locke refers to him by name. Again, 1
think it would be very difficult for any one, after carefully reading the
yth Book of the De Augmentis and after tracing the obvious applica7
tions of Bacon's principles and method to the science of conduct,
to resist the conclusion that his speculations and, perhaps still more,
his method of investigation are, to a large extent, the source of that
great school of moral philosophy which, numbering men so widely
divergent in many respects as Hobbes and Cumberland, Butler aud
Bentham, agrees in basing the rules of conduct on an inductive
examinatiou of the principles of human nature and the consequences
of human actions. English philosophy, or, at least, much the larger
portion of it, seems tome to be thoroughly Buconian in its-aims,

¹⁴ There is avery prohable allusion to Bacou in the discussion on Syllogism,
which occurs in the chapter on Reason (bk. iv. ch. 17. 5 ⁴) : ‘And therefore
Syllogism has been thought more proper for the attaining Victory in Dispute, than
for the Discovery or Confirmation of Truth in fair enqnirles.' Cp„ smougst other
passages, Nov. Org. i. 13. ‘Assensnm itaque constringit, non rea’ The next
chose, ‘And if lt be certain that Fallacy can be couched in Syllogisrns, ss it cannot
be deuied, it must be something else, and uot Syllogism, that must discover them:
corresponds with Bacon's frequent plens for a new Logic which shall test the ‘prin-
cipia scientiarum’ themselves. Cp. also Loclse's Essay, bk. li. ch. aa. ς 1, with
Nov. Org. i. 4.

At the beginning of the short work on the Couduct of the Understanding, Lockc
justifies his own opinions on the insufficiency of the mles of the ‘Logic now in usc'
hy the authority of the ‘great Lord Verulam, who not servilely thinking learning
could nothe advanced beyond what it was, because for many ages it had not been,
did not rest in the lazy approbation and applanse of what was, because lt was ς bnt
enlargcd his mind to what might be.³ Thronghout this treatise‚ Bacon’s induenoe
is manifest. nt the same time, Locke's emphatic denial of the possibility of attain-
ing, by means of experiment and observation, to any certain knowledge with regard
to the general course of nature (see Essay, bk. iv. ch. 6) would seem to ahew either
that hc bad never read the Second Book of the Novam Organnm or that he did
not admit the assumptioni on which it proceeds.
