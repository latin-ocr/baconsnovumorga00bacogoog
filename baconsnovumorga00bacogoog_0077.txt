received theological opinions. Witness the following passages from
the essay of Unity in Religion: ‘Conceming the Bounds of Unity;
the true placing of them importeth exceedingly. There appear to be
two extremes. For to certain aeiants all speech os pacification is
odious. Is it peace, Jenur What narr than ta da aar'th peace? tarn thee
behind me. Peace is not the matter, but following and party. Con-
trariwise, certain Laodiceans and lukewarm persons think they may
accommodate points oi religion by middle ways, and taking part of
both, and witty reconcilements 3 as if they would make an arbitrement
between God and man. Both these extremes are to be avoided 3
which will be done, if the league of Christians penned by our Saviour
himself were in the two cross clauses thereof soundly and plainly
expounded: He thar is not with us is against ns ,· and again, He tnat
. is nat against us is carih us ,· that is, if the points fundamental and ol

points not merely of saith, but os opinion, order, or good intention.
This is a thing may seem to manya matter trivial, and done already.
But if it were done less partially, it would be embraced more generally.’
‘Conceming the Means of procuring Unity; men must benene,
that in the procuring or muniting of religious unity they do not

But we may not take up the third sword, which is Mahomet’s sword,
or like unto it; that is, to propagate religion by wars or by sanguinary
persecutions to force consciences3 except it be in cases os overt
scandal, blasphemy, or intermixture os practice against the state3
much less to nourish seditions; to authorise conspiracies and rebel-
lions3 to put the sword into the people’s hands; and the like: tending
to the subversion of all government, which is the ordinance of God.
For this is but to dash the first table against the second ; and so to
consider men as Christians‚ as we forget that they are men. Lucretius
the poet, when he beheld the act oi Agamemnon, that could endure
the sacrificing of his own daughter, exclaimed:

Tantum Relligio potuit suadere maiomm:

What would he have said, if he had known of the massacre in
France, or the powder treason of England? He would have been
seven times more· Epicure and atheist than he was. For as the
temporal sword is to be drawn with great circumspectiori in cases
of religion3 so it is a thing monstrous to put it into the hands of
