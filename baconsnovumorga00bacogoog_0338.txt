induction based on simple enumeration, but, where an induction is based
on elimination 3ηά seems to establish a causal connection, the strong pre·
sumption is that any exception is apparent only and is really due to some
counteracting cause. Cp. Cogitata et Visa (E. aud 8., vol. iii. p. 618):
‘Visum est ei talem inductionis formam inveniendam, quae ex aliquibus
generaliter concludat; ita ut instantiam contradictoriam inveniri uon posse
demonstretur!

¹ Thus, a rnan living in one part oi the globe might infer irum the men
whom he had seen that alimen are white, a man living in another part that
ull men are black, and so on.

² This is Scientific Induction, as distinguished from Inductio per Enu-
merationem Simplicem. But, though Bacon had lonned the idea oia
Scientitic Induction, or a process oi eliminatiou by means oi which causes
might bc detected, his own account ol the process 3ηά ol the rules by
which it should be conducted is, sor the most part, vague and not suffi-
ciently adopted to practice. Subsequent writers, especially Sir John Her-
schel, Dr. Whewell‚ and Mr. Mill, have renderedthese rules at once more
precise 3ηά better adapted to practice. See notes on Bk. ii. Aphs. 11—18,
and Introduction, ἐξ 9, 15.

³ There can be no question that Bacon is here alluding to the Method
oi Exclusions, ol which he gives an instance in Bk. ii. Aph. 18. See note
70 on the ambiguous passage in Bk. i. Aph. 69. The second oi the
alternative explanations, which were there proposed, is, ol course, the
one which is applicable here.

The deiecta oi Bacon's Method οἱ Exclusion (for a further account ol
which see § 9 ol the Introduction to this edition and Mr. Ellis's Prelace
to Bacon’s Philosophical Works, E. and S., vol. i. pp. 22-39) are tolerably
obvious. There is, lirst, the difficulty, amountiug, in most cases, almost
to impossibility, ol ascertaining that all the possible explanatione or causes
of the given phenomenon have been passed in raview. Then, again, we
not only require rules to exclude false theories, but also tests to satisly
ourselves ol the truth ol the theory which we ultimately adopt. These,
however, Bacon might have maintained, are, at least, suggested in ii. 15,
aad, to a certain extent, supplied in some oi the Praerogativae Instan-
tiarum.

⁴ But in the Temporis Partus Masculus (E. and S, vol. iii. p. 530) he
abuses Plato, amongst other things, sor his Induction, and apostrophises
him thus: ‘ ..... animosque vagis inductionibus tentares et exsolveres!
By the Platonic Induction in that and the present passage, he probably
