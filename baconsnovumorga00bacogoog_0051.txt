common to the individual good. ‘Nulla omnibus saeculis reperta
est vel philosophia vel secta vel religio vel lex aut disciplina, quae in
tantum Communionis Bonum exaltavit, Bonum vero Individuale de
pressit, quantum Sancta Fides Christiana; unde liquido pateat unum
eundemque Deum fuisse, qui creaturis leges illas Naturae, hominibus
vero legem Christianam dedisset ⁴⁰.’

It is a remark very characteristic of Bacon’s point of view that the
superiority os the public to the private good determines the contro
versy as to the relative advantages of the practical and contemplative
lise in favour of the former. For the reasons, he sayS, adduced by
Aristotle in favour of the latter have respect only to private good
and the pleasure or dignity of the individual. Nor, is the monastic
life had been regarded as merely and strictly contemplative, could
any doubt on this question have ever arisen in the church: ‘Con-
templativam vero quod attinet meram, et in seipsa terminatam,

proper sense of the term, but in his assertion of the necessity of a
new methodos a new range oi studies, ol a new spirit oi enquiry.
He was a logician, in the widest and lullest sense of the word.
A philosopher he did not claim to be; and, though Ι believe that
his works exerted a very powersul influence on the philosophica}
speculations ol the two succeeding centuries‚a philosopher, in the
strict sense of the term, he was not.

, Or the many charges brought against Bacon, as a philosopher
and a reformer ol science, there are three, connected with the present
subject, which it would be vain to deny, though, in the course of
this enquiry, we may find something to plead in extenuation os them.
The first is that he was a Dilettante in science. The second, that
he was imperfectly acquainted with the existing state of knowledge.
