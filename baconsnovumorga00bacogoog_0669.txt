Bacon's own theory, therefore, was that me atoms, instead oi being
separated by a vacuum, have the power of expanding and contracting
themselves, so as exactly to adjust themselves, one to another, without
leaving any intervening space.

Plica (from plico) is explained by Du Cange as ‘plicatura vel involutio!

⁷⁶ ‘Nor is there in air two thousand times more oi vacuity than in gold?
Bacon appears to regard this supposition as a reductio ad absurdum os the
theory oi a vacuum. ln ii. 40, he states the density oi gold at 21 times
that oi spirits oi wine, and that oi spirits oi wine at too times that oi its
own vapour; while, in the Historia Densi et Rari (E. and S.„vol. ii. p. 25 5),
he says that all furnes are denser than air. This calculation would make
the density of gold more than 2100 times greater than that oi air, or,
speaking roughly, 2000 times greater. Bacon, who was not much oi a
mathematician, probably took for granted that the ratio of the amounts oi
vacuity, supposing a vacuum possible, contained in equal weights of the
two bodies, would be inversely that oi the densities. Eut this is plainly
not the case.

Proceeding on a calculation based on passages in the Historia Densi et
Rari only, Mr. Ellis makes the supposed density oi gold 190ofold that
oi air. Supposing that nineteen-twentieths oi the gold consisted oi vacuity
(perhaps not an extravagant calculation, when we consider the supposed
density of the bodies in the interior of the earth), the ratio of the sup·
posed vacuity in the same weights oi air and gold would = 1899 4 {23:33
