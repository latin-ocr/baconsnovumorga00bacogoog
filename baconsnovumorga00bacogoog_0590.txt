per circulum: motu seilicet aeterno et infinito. Quae bene
collocata sunt, et motum exhorrent, prorsus quiescunt. Quae
non bene collocata sunt, movent in linea recta (tanquam
tramite brevissimo) ad consortia suorum connaturalium ⁶⁰.
Recipit autem motus iste rotationis differentias novem ⁵⁷.
Primam, centri sui, eirca quod corpora movent: secundam,
polorum suorum, supra quos movent: tertiam, circumferentiae
sive ambitus sui, prout distant a centro: quartam, incitationis
suae, prout celerius aut tardius rotant: quintam, conse-
quutionis motus sui, veluti ab oriente in occidentem, aut ab
occidente in orientem: sextam, declinationis a circulo perfecto
per spiras longius aut propius distantes a centro suo: septi·
mam, declinationis a circulo perfecto per spiras longius aut
propius distantes a polis suis: octavam, distantiae propioris
aut longioris spirarum suarum ad invicem: nonam et ultimam,
variationis ipsorum polorum ⁵⁸, si sint mobiles3 quae ipsa ad
rotationem non pertinet, nisi fiat circulariter ⁵⁹. Atque iste

⁵⁸ ‘This passage is wholly in accordance with the Peripatetic system of
physies. But the modifications which Baeon goes on to enumerate, to
which, as he conceives, the eternal circular motions of the heavenly bodies
may be subject, are sufficient to destroy the whole d pm'on‘ argument in
favour of such a system of astronomy as that which we find in the twelfth
book of the Metaphysics. lt has not been sufficiently observed that the
Ptolemais system is no less at variance with the Peripatetic philosophy
than the heliocentrical. The attempts of Turrianus and Fraeastorius to
construet what may be called an orthodox system of astronomy—that is
one in which all the motions should take place in circles of which the earth
is the eentre—was suggested chiefly, as we leam from the Homocentriea
of the latter, by the wish to reconcile astronomy and philosophy. 1t had
no seientifie value, since it left all the phenomena of variatione of parallax
and apparent diameter unexplained‚ or, at any rate, gave an explanation of
them which no astronomer would accept. lt was nevertheless favourably
reoeived by the systematie Peripaticians. See, for instance, Flaminius,
De prima Philosoph. Paraph. p. 119. (1 quote the Basle edition of 1557.)'

Μ That is, nine respects in which the motions may differ.

⁸⁸ That is, libration.

The reader need hardly be again reminded that he will find a detailed
account of Bacon's astronomical views (written, however, about eight years
before the publication of the Novum Organum), in the Descriptio Globi
Intellectualis and the appended' tract Thema Coeli (E. and S., vol. iii.
