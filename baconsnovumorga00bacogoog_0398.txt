‘⁴ Dr. Kitchin has the following interesting note on this passage: ‘The
questions started here and in the next paragraph have been settled 3 and
the result is such as proves the similarity in kind of Solar and other
Heat; so that in these places no Negative can be adduced. Large
lenses brought before lighted candles or the fire produce sensible Heat;
and by collecting the rays of Heat in the atmosphere, even when the
Suu is quite hidden behind clouds, concave Mirrors produce a definite
increase of Heat at tbeir focus. Farther than this, MM. Saussure and
Pictet of Geneva have established the truth as to “ferrum, vel lapis
calefactus, sed non ignitus,” dcc. by hearing an iron ball so as not to be
luminous, and by experimenting on boiling water. From the results
they have shewn that Heat emanates in invisible rays, and is subject to
the same laws of reflexion, &o as if it were accompanied by rays of light
as well. Melloni has also established the fact that Heat is refrangible;
and (like Ligbt of different colours) Heat from different sources has
different degrees of refrangibility. Forbes has established the polarisa-
tion of Heat from both luminous and non-luminous sources: he also
depolarised Heat; and as this is a consequence solely of double refrac-
tion, he thereby has proved that Heat is subject also to the Laws of
double refraction. See Tumer's Chemistry, Heat, pp. 14—2o.’

‘Mersenne says tbe greater number of the experiments mentioned in
the second book of the Novum Organum had already been made, and
mentions particularly, as if he had himself tried it, the reflexion of all
kinds of heat by a buming mirror. He also asserts that light is always
accorupanied by heat. De la verite des Sciences (1625), p. 210) Mr.
Ellis' note. ln the great majority of cases, 1 think, there is nothing in
Bacon's language to imply that the experimenta suggested are original.
See Aph. 14.

‘⁶ It was a common subject of debate amongst the ancient astronomers
whether Cornets were to be regarded as Meteors (which were supposed
to be engendered in tbe atmosphere), or whether they were more
analogous to the Planets. The point is discussed in a most interesting
manner in the Seventh Book of Seneca's Natural Questions. ‘Placet
ergo nostris cometas sicut faces, sicut tubas trabesque et alia ostenta
coeli denso aere creari! He then argues with great ability against this
view, referring to the comets which appeared in the time of Claudius
and Nero, and sums ophis own opinion as follows: ‘Ego nostris non
