RELATION TO BACON'S OTHER WORKS. 7

mentis, published in 1623 (about three years aster the publication of
the Novum organum), and founded on a previous work, written in
English and published in 1605, entitled, Of the Proficience and
Advancement of Learning. When the latter work was written,
Bacon had probably not yet matured his conception of the Great
Instauration. Theseis afragment of a work on the same subject,
intennediate in date between these two, first published by Gruter
in 1653, entitled Descriptio Globi Intellectualis. This tract, which
may be referred to about the year 1612, was designed on a larger
scale than either of the two already referred to. The part worked out
is mainly on Astronomy, and appended to it is another tract, entitled
Thema Coeli, giving a provisional account of Bacon's own astrono
micel views, and evidently forming part of the same worlc Por-
tions of the tract entitled Valerius Terminus, referred to in the last·
paragraph also go over the same mound as the Advancement and
the De Augmentis.

The second part of the Great Instauration, or the proper method
of interpreting Nature, was evidently the one (if we except the sixth‚
which was to be the crown of the whole, and the gradual work of
posterity) to which Bacon attached the greatest importance. It is
mainly represented by the Novum Organum, though preliminary
drafts of portions of this work are to be found in parts of the
Valerius Terminus, and in the Partis Secundae Delineatio, the
Cogitata et Visa, the Temporis Partus Masculus, and the Filum
labyrinthi sive Inquisitio Legitima de Motu, to say nothing of
smaller pieceS, such as De Interpretatione Naturae Sententiae Duo
decim, &c The scheme of the Valerius Terminus does not appear
to extend beyond the first and second parts of the Great Instaura-
tion, and another peculiarity is that what in the Novum Organum
is called the investigation of the form is there (ch. 11) called the
fresing of a direction. In the Partis Secundae Delineatio we have,
as already noticed, the first intimation of the six parts of the Great
Instauration, but neither there nor in Valerius Terminus does the
idea yet seem to have occurred to Bacon of setting forth his meaning
mainly by means of an example. This plan is announced at the
end of the Cogitata et Visa ⁷, and is worked out in the second book
