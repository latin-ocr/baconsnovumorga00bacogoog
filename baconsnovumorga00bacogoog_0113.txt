Far the most systematic oi the opponents oi the Aristotelian phi-
' losophy in general was Patrizzi or Patricius (b. 1529, d. ¹597)· His
Discussiones Peripateticae are throughout, sor the most part, a bitter
attack on the liie, works, and opinions os Aristotle. Thus, he sre-
quently breaks out into invectives such as this: ‘Quicunque igiturex
Aristotelis dogmatibus philosophatur, is dialectice philosophatur, non
philosophice, non scientifice, non rerum veritatis, sed Aristotelicorum
placitorum est amator ⁹⁶! And, in another place, aiter comparing
two contradictory passages from Aristotle, he says: ‘Qua re quid in-
constantius? quid tanti nominis philosopho indignius? Sed licuit
sibi quidquid voluit: et tamen, omnia credita a suis sunt oracula, in
contrariis dogmatibus permultis fides par illi habita ”J His reasons
ior combating the philosophy of Aristotle are given at length in an
Appendix, entituled ‘Veritatis Studiosis,’ at the end os his ‘Nova de
Universis Philosophia!

Giordano Bruno (b. about 1550, bumt at Rome 1600) was another
oi the more prominent opponents of Aristotelianism. He wrote a
special treatise, entituled Acrotismus, seu rationes articulorum physi-
corum adversus peripateticos Parisiis propositorum. In the Dedica-
tion prefixed to this work, he says that he should not have written the
book, had he thought that the University os Paris owed more to
Aristotle, than Aristotle to it. In the celebrated Dialogue, entituled
‘La Cena de le Ceneri‚’ Bruno states that the most enthusiastic ad-
herents oi Aristotle (⁴ who are the enemies oi those who are not the
friends oi Aristotle, who would live and die ior Aristotle ’) are osten
entirely ignorant oi the meaning oi even the titles oi his works (‘i
quali non intendono ne anche quel che significano i titoli de libri
d'Aristotele ’). He adds that the real question which ought to be
debated between the Aristotelians and their opponents is not whether
a doctrine be old or new, but whether it be true or salse ⁹⁸.

ι Campanella (b. 1568, d. 1639) was an enthusiastic follower of
Telesio, and one oi the more outspolren oi the anti-Aristoteliam. One

oi his works, published at Naples in 1591, was entituled Philosophia
sensibus demonstrata; adversus eos qui proprio arbitratu, non autem

totelis Sententiis] tractandis plus justo interdurn immoremur, mortales uobis, ut
ignoscant, sed quod a summo naturae interprete dissentire audeamus et non
numinis instar illum veneremur, rogandos esse existimamus: qui si illius dictum
audiant, aut iactum imitentur,’ &c
