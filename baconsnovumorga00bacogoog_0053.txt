of Series, and fully recognised the importance of them as an aid
to physical enquiries ; he does not say a word about Napier’s
Logarithms, which had been publlshed only nine years before and
reprinted more than once in the interval ⁴⁴. He complained that no
considerable advance had¹ been made in Geometry beyond Euclid‚
without taking any notice of what had been done by Archimedes and

Apollonius⁴³. He saw the importance of determining accurately the
specific gravities of different substances‚ and himself attempted to
form a table of them by a rude process of his own, without knowing
of the more scientific though still imperfect methods previously
employed by Archimedes, Ghetaldus‚ and Porta ⁴⁸. He speaks of
the εὕρηκα 11 Archimedes in a manner which implies that he did not
clearly apprehend either the nature of the problem to be solved or

satiaveris et commoda inventa sunt Supputationum compendia, praesertim circa
Progressiones, quarum in Physicis usus est non mediocria' On this passage Mr.
Ellis observes in his note: ‘One would certainly not infer from this remark, to
which there is nothing corresponding in the Adrancement of learning, that Bacon
was sware that. in the interval which had elapsed sinoe its publication, the greatest
of all inventione for facilitating arithmetioal computatione had been made known.
Napier's Logarithms were publlshed in 1614, and repn'nted on the continent in
16203 in which year Gunter's Canon of Triangles was also publlshed. In 1618
Robert Napier'saecount of his father's method and Briggs's first table of Logarithms
were both published. In the year succeeding that of the publication of the De
Augmentis his larger tables, and probably those of Wingate‚ made their appearance?

‘These dates are sufficient to show how much the attention of mathematicians was
given to the subject. lt would almost seem as if some one, possibly saviis, had
told Bacon—what was no doubt true—that the application of the doctrine of series
to arithmetioal computation was notas yet brought to perfectiori, and that he had
adopted the remark without understanding the importanoe of the discovery to
which it referred, and perhaps without being aware that any such discovery had
been made?

1 may add that an English translation of Napier's Logarithms by Edward Wright
was publlshed at London in 1616, and republlshed ln 1618.]

medes Promotus of Marinus Ghetaldus was publlshed at Rome in 1603. His
method of finding specific gravities has, as Mr. Ellis remarks (rol. ii. p. 230),
remained in use, with certain modificatione and corrections, to the present day.
The first complete edition of Baptista Porta's Natural Magia was publlshed at Naples
in 1589. Many of the ‘experiments' in Bacon's Sylva Sylrarum are said by Mr.
Ellis to be taken from this work. Bacon, therefore, probably beorum acquainted
with it between writlng the Historia Densi et Rari and the Sylva Sylvarum.]
