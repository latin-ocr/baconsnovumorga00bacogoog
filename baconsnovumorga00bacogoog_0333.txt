304 NOVUM ORGANUM.

vatione indefinitum et vagum, id in informatione fallax et
infidum est. Quod si cui haec mira dictu videantur, et que-
relae minus justae propiora, cum Aristoteles tantus ipse vir,
et tanti regis opibus subnixus tam accuratam de animalibus
historiam confecerit, atque alii nonnulli majore diligentia (licet
strepitu minore) multa adjecerint, et rursus alii de plantis, de
metallis, et fossilibus, historias et narrationes copiosas con·
scripserint3 is sane non satis attendere et perspicere videtur,
quid agatur in praesentia. Alia enim est ratio naturalis his·
toriae, quae propter se confecta est3 alia ejus, quae collecta
est ad informandum intellectum in ordine ad condendam
philosophiam ⁸¹. Atque hae duae historiae tum aliis rebus, tum
praecipue in hoc differunt3 quod prima ex illis specierum
naturalium varietatem, non artium mechanicarum experi-
menta contineat. Quemadmodum enim in civilibus ingenium
cujusque, et occultus animi affectuumque sensus, melius eli-
citur, cum quis in perturbatione ponitur, quam alias: simili
modo, et occulta naturae magis se produnt per vexationes
artium, quam cum cursu suo meant ⁸². Itaque tum demum
bene sperandum est de naturali philosophia, postquam historia

measuring, and counting in conducting obsenrations or experimenta, it is
now needless to insist. The student will find abrief and excellent account
of ‘ Methods of Observation' in Whewell's Novum Organum Renovatum,
book iii. ch. 2. ff he wishes to prrrsue the subject at greater length, he
may read with advantage the Third Book of Professor Jevons’ Principles
of seleuce, entituled ‘Methods of Measurement.’

⁸¹ Bacon constantly insists on the subordination of Natural History to
Natural Philosophy. But it is difficolt to conceive any philosophica] writer
collecting natural facts for any other purpose than that of basing on them
philosophical generalisations. Aristotle, certainly, is not chargeable with
this fault.

It was not on any difference in the objects for which they were collected,
buton the number, variety, accuracy, and pertinency of the observations,
and on the distinctiva character of the inductive method which was to be
applied to them, when collected, that Bacon should have insisted as dis-
tinguishing tle Natural History which he designed to inaugurate from that
of his predecessors.

⁸² Nature best discovers her secrets, when tortured by Art. This isan
excellent illustration of the advantage which Experiment, at least in many
cases, possessos over Observation. For the differences between the two
processes, see Mill's Logic, bk. iii. ch. 7, or my Inductive Logic, ch. 2.
