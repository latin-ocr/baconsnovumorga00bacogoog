Non leve quiddam interest inter humanae mentis idola ²⁸,
et divinae mentis ideas²³3 hoc est, inter placita quaedam

ἐγγυτάτω δὲ rd καθ’ ἕκαστα· καὶ ἀντίκειται ταῦτ’ ἀλλήλοις. The student may
with advantage read Trendelenburgs note on this passage. See notes to
the Elementa Logices Aristoteleae, ξ 19.

Naturally, or in reference to Nature, according to Aristotle’s way of
thinking, the universal is prior to the individual, the cause to the effect,
the general law to the particular fact. By or in reference to us, on the
other band, the individualis better known than the universal, the effect
than the cause, the particular fact than the general law. Nature indeed
may be regarded as ever striving to reproduce the type in the individual,
to represent the general law in its special manifestations, to carry out tbe
cause into its effects. And so, by a figure of speech, it may be said to
have a better or prior knowledge of that which, in our case, comes last,
and as the result of a variety of mental operations.

Bacon here, as elsewhere, avails blmself of the Aristotelian distinction,
but seems to imply that with Aristotle the τῇ φύσει γνωριμώτερα were
mere useless abstractions‚ while he himself probably understands by the

revera naturae notiora' those ultimate causes or Forms, out of which,
asa sort of alphabet, he conceived that the various bodies, forces, and
qualities in nature were composed. For the further explanatIon of these
‘F orms,' the student must referto the Introduction.

Mr. Spedding notices that, in his English writings, Baton seems to use
the word ‘ original’ as equivalent to ‘naturae notior!

It is interesting to compare with tbis Aphorism the following passage
of the Distributio Operis: ‘At secundum nos, axiomata continenter et
gradatim excitantur, ut nonnisi postremo loco ad generalissima veniatur :
ea vero generalissima evadunt non notionalia, sed bene terminata, et talia
quae natura ut revera sibi notiora agnoscat, quaeque rebus haereant in
medullis! ·

²⁸ εἴδωλα, ‘phantoms' or ‘ spectres,’ not ‘ idols ³ in the sense of false gods,
as several writers have interpreted it. In the De Augnentis, lib. v. oap. 4,
they are called Imagines sive Idola, and in the second of the Two Books
on tbe Advancement of Leaming, published in 1605, they are spoken of
as ‘false appearances that are imposed upon us' by ‘the general nature
of the mind,' by ‘worda’ etc. F or the latter passage, see Ellis and
Spedding’s Edition of Bacon’s Works, vol. iii. pp. 394—7. Mr. Hallam
(Literature of Europe, part iii. ch. 3. §dol gives some amusing extracts
from the authors who have mistaken the meaning of the word.

²⁹ Are these ‘ideas of the divine mind’ tbe‘ forms’ of which Baton
will speak hereafter? That God created all things in conformity with
certain ideas, forms, or exernplars in hIs own mind, as the sculptor fashions
a statue, and that thus, in a certain sense, the world had a pre-existence
in tbe mind of God, is a commonplace of philosophy and theology. Cp.
Campanella, Metapbysica, pars i. lib. i. Prooemium: ‘Propterea nil est
