ΗΒ. II. 48. 541

corpora integra ex similitudine substantiae se amplectuntur
et fovent, et quandoque ad distantiam aliquam congregantur,
attrahuntur, et conveniunt ⁸⁵: veluti cum in lacte lios lactis
post moram aliquam supernatat; in vino faeces et tartarum
subsidunt ⁸⁶. Neque enim haec fiunt per motum gravitatis
et levitatis tantum, ut aliae partes summitatem petant, aliae

ad imum vergant; sed multo magis per desiderium homo·
geneorum inter se coeundi et se uniendi ⁸⁷. Differt autem

iste motusa motu indigentiae, in duobus. Uno, quod in
motu indigentiae sit stimulus major naturae malignae et
contrariae; at in hoc motu (si modo impedimenta et vincula
absint) uniuntur partes per amicitiam, licet absit natura aliena
quae litem moveat: altero, quod arctior sit unio, et tanquam
majore cum delectu. In illo enim, modo evitetur corpus inimi-

variations in size, form, weight, or specific gravity. Sometimes it may be
a question to which of these causes a phenomenon may be duc.

²⁶ Α good instance would be that of two corks‚ both wet or both dry,
floating near each other on water. Foranexplanation of this phenomenon,
see Everett's Translation of Deschanel's Nat. Phil. Pt. i. p. 136, or Daguin,
Tmitt de Physique, Tome i. pp. 209-10, 23¹¹¹⁰ Ed).

‘⁸ ln both cases, the phenomenon is due to differences of specific gravity,
the lighter particles rising to the top, and the heavier falling to the bottom.

⁸⁷ An excellent illustration of Bacon’s meaning may be found in the
commonly received opinion with regard to the formation of fiint nodules.
See Phillips' Manual of Geology, pp. 358-9, or Page’s Advanced Text Book
of GeoIngy, 6th Ed, pp. 350-4 The latter author discusses the question
at some length, and concludes: ‘From these facts it would seem that flints
are aggregations of silex round some organic nucleus, just like the ironstone
septaria of the coal·shales, the grains of the oolite, the ironstone nodules of
the gault-all of which are aggregations round some organic centre, be it a
fragment of plant, a shell, a tooth, coprolite, or other organism. This is
now the generally received opinion ; and, when it is remembered that the
organisms must have been deposited when the challc was in a tiocculent
and pulpy state, there can be little difficulty in conceiving how the silex,
held in solution by the waters of deposit, would, by chemical affinity‚
attach itself to the decaying organism! Dr. Bowerbanlr applies a similar
theory even to beds of tabular flint, supposing that the sponges originating
the deposit had developed themselves laterally, and that, approaching and

touching each other, they united and thus formed extensive and continuous .

beds. On the formation of nodules generally, see also Lyell's Student's
Elements of Geology, and Ed, p. 40.

Since the appearance of the tst Edition, this subject has been treated,
at considerable length, by Professor Prestwich in his admirable treatise
ou Geology, Part ii. ch. 20.
