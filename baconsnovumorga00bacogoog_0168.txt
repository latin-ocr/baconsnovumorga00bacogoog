OPPONENTS OF BACON. 139

but, as the various topics have all been discussed in previous sections,
I shall here make no comment upon it.

‘The great glory of literature in this island, during the reign of
James, was Lord Bacon. Most oi his performances were composed
in Latin3 though be possessed neither the elegance of that, nor os
his native tongue. If we consider the variety os talents displayed by
this man, as a public speaker, a man os business, awit, a courtier,
a companion, an author, a philosopher, he is justlythe objectos great
admiration. Ii we consider him merelyas an author and philosopher,
the light in which we view him at present, though very estimable, he
was yet interior to his cotemporary Galileo, perhaps even to Kepler.
Bacon pointed out at a distance the road to true philosophy: Galileo
both pointed it out to others, and made himself considerable advances
in it. The Englishman was ignorant ol geometry: the Florentine
revived that science, excelled in it, and was the first that applied it,
together with experiment, to natural philosophy. The ionner rejected,
with the most positive disdain, the system oi Copernicus: the latter ‚
sortified it with new prools, derived both from reason and the senses.
Bacon's style is stin and rigid: his wit, though often brilliant, is also
osten unnatural and sar-letched3 and he seems to be the original of
those pointed similes and long-spun allegories, which so much dis·
tinguish the English authors: Galileo is a lively and agreeable,
though somewhat a prolix, writer. But Italy, not united in any single
government, and perhaps satiated with that literary glory which it
bas possessed both in ancient and modern times, has too much
neglected the renown which it has acquired by giving birth to so
great a man. That national spirit which prevails among the English,
and which forms their great happiness, is the cause why they bestow
on all their eminent writers, and on Bacon among the rest, such
praises and acclamations, as may osten appear partial and excessive ⁶⁴)

The excessive praise bestowed on Bacon by Voltaire and the
Encyclopaedists, though met at first by the argument that they did
not truly represent the views oi Bacon, at last provoked a violent
reaction, to which the well-known work of Count Joseph de Maistre
gave expression. This work, entitled Examen de la Philosophie de
Bacon, was published posthumously at Paris and Lyons in 1836,
