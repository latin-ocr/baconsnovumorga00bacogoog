XL.

Excitatio notionum et axiomatum⁴⁶ per deductionem veram
est certe proprium remedium ad idola arcenda et sum-
movenda3 sed tamen indicatio idolorum magni est usus.
Doctrina enim de idolis similiter se habet ad interpretationem
naturae, sicut doctrina de sophisticis elenchis ad dialecticam
vulgarem ⁴⁷.

XLI.

Idola tribus sunt fundata in ipsa natura humana, atque in
ipsa tribu seu gente hominum ⁴⁸. Falso enim asseritur,

evelli possunt. ld tanturn relinquitur, ut indicentur, atque ut vis ista
mentis insidiatrix notetur et convincatur. . . .. ltaque doctrina ista de
expurgatione intellectus ut ipse ad veritatem habilis sit, tribus redargu·
tionibus absolvitur: redargutione philosophiam, redargutione demon·
strationum, et redargutione rationis humanae nativae.¹ Cp. the Partis
Secundae Delineatio (E. and S., vol. iii. p. 548), and see Mr. Spedding's
remarks in Note C. to the Preface to the Novum Organum (vol. i. pp. 113-
117), where the whole question of the higher classitication of the ldola is
carefully considered. This higher classilication of Adscititia and lnnata
disappears in the Novum Organum, because, as Mr. Spedding says, when
Bacon ‘came to describe the several ldols one by one, he became aware
both of the logical inconsistency of classing the Idola Fori among the
innata, and of the practical inconvenience of classing them among the
Adscititia, and therefore resolved to drop the dichotomy altogether and
range thern in four co·ordinate classes! .

⁴⁶ Bacon regarded Induction as requisite both to give cleamess and
precision to our notions and to establish true propositions which might
serve as the basis of subsequent reasoning, whether inductive or deduc-
tive. But, as we have already seen (note to Aph. 14), in order to realise
or test the truth or adequacy of a notion, we must form at least one, and
frequently a number ofjudgments. When we employ induction, therefore,
‘to elicit a notion,' we necessarily also employ it ‘to elicit an axiom,' and
hence there is no real distinction between the process of induction or
generalisation as applied to notions and as applied to judgments, propo·
sitiens, oraxioms. .

⁴⁷ That is to say, it is Bacon’s Doctrine of Fallacies, and its fonction is
to clear the mind of false notions, in order that it may be open to the
reception of true ones. ·

⁴⁸ Must we then despair of the possibility of attaining knowledge? We
cannot, indeed, transcend the limitations of our own faculties, or know
things except in relation to our own bodily and mental constitution3 but
by comparing our impressions and inferences, one with another, and with
those of other rnen, and, above all, by constantly reviewing and correcting

· our conceptions by comparison with the facts of Nature, we are able
