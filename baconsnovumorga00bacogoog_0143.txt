‘From these and all long Errors ol the way,

ln which our wandring Praedooessors went,

And like th' old Hebrews many years did stray
ln Deserta hut ol small extent,

Bacon, like Moses, led us lorth at last,

The barren Wilderness he past,
Did on the very Border stand

It should be noticed that Sprat's book received the sanction os the
Royal Society, and that copies ol it were sent by thern to foreign
princes and other eminent persons on the continent. Hence Liebig's

Francis Bacon (Lord Verulam) in England, hath been much culti-
vated in Italy, France, Germany‚ and other parts abroad, as well as

In the Dedication to the Royal Society ol his Scepsis Scientifica
