est cautio, et cohibendus impetus intellectus⁶¹. Quicquid enim
ostentat formam, eamque trudit, ut videatur occurrere in-
tellectui, pro suspecto habendum est, et recurrendum ad ex-
clusivum severam et diligentem.

Exempli gratia3 sit natura inquisita Calidum. Instantia
Ostensiva motus expansionis quae (ut superius dictum est)
portio est praecipua⁶² formae calidi, est vitrum calendare aeris⁶³.

³¹ Cp. i. 47. There is sometimes a danger lest these ‘glaring instances’
should produce an undue effect on the mind, to the prejudice of other
instances less striking, but, perhaps, equally or more instructive; and
hence the need of cantion. This is all that Bacon seems to mean.

⁶² ln Aph ao, ‘motus expansivus' is given as the ‘prima differentia’
of heat.

⁶⁸ The thermometer, as exhibiting the expansive power of heat, is a
good example of a glan'ng instance. l add some others.

‘lf the weight of the air were inquired into, the Torricellian experi-
ment, or the barometer‚ affords an osteruive instance, where the circum-
stance which conceals the weight of the atmosphere in common cases,
hemely, the pressure of it in all directions, being entirely removed, that
weight produces its full effect, and sustains the whole column of mercury
in the tube. The barometer affords also an example of the instantia
migrans, when the change is not total, but only partial or progressive.
lf it be the weight of the air which supports the mercury in the tube
of the barometer‚ when that weight is diminished, the mercury ought
to stand lower. On going to the top oi a mountain, the weight of the
incumbent air is diminished‚ because a shorter column of air is to be
sustained3 the mercury in the barometer ought therefore to sink, and it
is found to do so accordingly.

‘These are instances in which the action of certain principles is ren-
dered visible by the removal of ull the opposing forces. One may be
given where it is the distinct and decisive nature of this fact which leads
to the result.

‘Suppose it were inquired‚ whether the present land had ever been
covered by the sea. lf we look at the stratified form of so large a portion
of the earth’s surface‚ we cannot but conclude it to be very probable that
such land was formed at the bottom of the sea. But the decisive proof
is afforded hythe shells and corals, or bodies having the perfect shape
of shells and corals and of other marine exuviae, which are found im-
bedded in masses of the most solid rock, and often on the tops of very
high mountains.¹ Playfair, Preliminary Dissertation.

‘The laws of crystallogrnphy were obscure, and its causes still more so,
till Haiiy fortunately dropped a beautiful crystal of calcareous spar on a
stone pavement, and broke it. ln piecing together the fragments he
observed their facets not to correspond with those of the crystal in its
entire state, but to belong to another form; and, following out the hint
