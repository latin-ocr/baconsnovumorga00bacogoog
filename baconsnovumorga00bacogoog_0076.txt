BACON’S RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 47

4th. With respect to the Christian mysteries, Bacon seems, at least
in his earlier years, to have been inclined to trust himself to the
guidance of the church3 meaning, doubtless, the church as under-
stood by James and Andrevves, which, passing over the intermediate
times of Roman superstition, boasted of its now restored connexion
with the age of the primitive fathers. ‘At restat adhuc,' he says, at
the beginning of the last Book of the De Augmentis ‘Theologia
Sacra, sive Inspirata. Veruntamen si eam tractare pergamus, ex-
eundum nobis foret e Navicula Rationis Humanae, et transeundum
in Ecclesiae Navem3 quae sola Acu Nautica Divina pollet ad cursum
recte dirigendum! How far Bacon's confidence in the ‘ship of the·
church' was implicit, and without exception, is, 1 think, somewhat f
doubtful. For it is a notable fact (which 1 have not seen elsewhere
noticed) that the passage on the nature and attributes of God,
including certain statements on the Trinity and the division of the
elect and reprobate, which occurs towards the end oi the Advance .
ment of Learning, is altogetherleft out in the De Augmentis, published
eightcen years afterwards. Nor, generally, do 1 notice in Bacon's ¹
later works any disposition to enter into details on the more specific
doctrines of religion ²⁶.

5th. Connected with this fact, is the very wide toleration which he l
was evidently ready to concede to dissidents from the more generally

says nothing to intimate any desire of positively excluding it bom the sphere of
these enqniriea.

¹⁵ Macanlay (Essay on Bacon) says, on the whole, very trnly: ‘He loved to
duell on the power of the Christian religion to effect much that the ancient philo·
sophera could only promise. He ioved to consider that religion as the bond of
charity, the cnrb of evil passinus, the consolation of the wretched, the support of ibe
timid, the bope of the dying. But controversies on speculative points of theology
seem to have engaged searoely any portion oi his attention. In what he wrote on
Church Gorernment he shewed, as far as he dared, a tolerant and charitable spirit.
He troubled himself not at all about Homoonsians and Homoiousians, Monothc·
lites and Nestorians He lived in an age in which disputes on the most subtle
points of divinity excited an intense interest throughout Europe, and nowhere more
than in Englaud. He was placed iu the very thick of the conflict. He was in
power at the time of the Synod of Dort, and must for months bave been daily
deafened with talk about election, reprobation, and final perseverance. Yet we do
not remember a line in his worls from which it can be inferred that be was either
a Calvinist oran arminianff Iam disposed, however, to think that this description
applies with more complete aeemacy to Bacon's later thau hia earlier state of feel-
ing on these subjecte.

Dr. Abbott (⁸ F rancis Bacon,' p. 405) criticises the passage in the Text, in which
1 bave suggested a change of opinion on religione subjecte in Bacon's later years.
ln the Preface 1 have explained why I cannot accept hia criticism.
