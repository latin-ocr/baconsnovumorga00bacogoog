¹⁰ This word is opposed to desiccationem. It is another of the numerous
words employed by Racon, which are not found in classica] Latin. Nor
is it recognised by Du cange.

¹¹ Cp. Historia Densi et Rari, E. and 5., vol. ii. p. 295 ; New Atlantis,
E. and S., vol. iii. p. 157. Mr. Ellis refers to Marco Polo, ii. 77. ln
Marsden's Translation of Marco Polo (london, 1818), the passage runs as
follows: ‘They collect a certain kind of earth, as it were from a mine,
and, laying it in a great heap, suffer it to be exposed to the wind, the rain,
and the sun, for thirty or forty years, during which time it is never dis·
turbed. By this it becomes retined and fit for being wrought into the
vessels above mentioned. Such colours as may be thought proper are
then laid on, and the ware is afterwards balred in ovens or tumaces
Those persons therefore who cause the earth to be dug, collect it for their
children or grandchildren.’ For the original, see Ramusio’s Collection:
‘Navigationi et Viaggi,' vol. ii. p. 49. The chapter is there numbered
as 79.

From the general resemblance between what Bacon says and the pas·
sage in Marco Polo, 1 can entertain little doubt that he had read it, or
some account taken from it. But, on the main point, it will be seen, the
passages are, discordant.

One of the numerous derivations of porcelain is the odd one ‘pour cent
annees ;' ‘because it was believed by Europeans, that the materials of
porcelain were matured under ground one hundred years! Dr. Johnson's
Dictionary. Cp. Sir Thomas Browne's Vulgar Errors, bk. ii. ch.5
(Piclrering’s Ed, vol. ii. pp. 352—4). Several authorities are there cited
both for and against this ‘common belief!

ln Col. Yule's Edition of Marco Polo, the passage given above is re·
jected as an interpolation of Ramusio. Commenting on it, Col. Yule says :
‘This story oi the life-long period during which the porcelain clay was
exposed to temper long held its ground, and probably was only dispelled
hythe publication of the details of the King·te·ching mantuacture by Pete
d'Entrecolles in the Lettres Edifiantes.'
