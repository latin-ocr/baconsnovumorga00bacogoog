absolute. In his deience, however, it ought to be pleaded that the
use os this topic in ancient and mediaeval philosophy, as wellas in the
writings of Bacon's contemporaries, was osten arbitrary, sanciiul, and
absurd to the last degree„ ‘The handling os final causes' had cer-
tainly ‘intercepted the severe and diligent inquiry oi all real and
physical causes‚'and it might well be maintained that their temporary
expulsion, could it have been eflected, would have been a real service
to science. As it was, I believe that the protest os Bacon and
Descartes‚ who was as little tolerant as Bacon himself of this mode
os explaining physical phenomena ⁸¹, exerted a decidedly wholesome
influence on the scientific procedure oi their successors.

In my Inductive Logic, 1 have given a large number oi instanees
of the absurd or misplaced employment oi this Argument, which, 1
think, will be quite sufficient to shew the pemieious and misleading
effect which, at times, it has exercised. To these and to my general
criticism os the Argument, 1 must, ior the sake of saving space, now

not be difficolt to maintaiu that Descartes' views, as expressed iu these passages,
were lnflueneed by those oi Bacou.

rejection of Final causes, which possesses much value or discrimination, is to be
iouud in Dugald Stewart's Elements, part ii. subdivision 1. ch. 4. sect. 6 (Ed.

require to be rocast, in view of the facts and theory oi Evolution. But the
