perpetuo trepidant, et irrequiete se agant ⁶⁴, nec statu suo
contenta, nec ulterius ausa progredi. Talis invenitur motus
in corde et pulsibus animalium3 et necesse est ut sit in
omnibus corporibus, quae statu ancipiti ita degunt inter
commodaret incommoda, ut distracta liberare se tentent, et
denuo repulsam patiantur, et tamen perpetuo experiantur ⁶⁶.
(19) Sit Motus Decimus Nonus et postremus, motus ille cui
vix nomen motus competit, et tamen est plane motus. Quem
motum, Motum Decubitus ⁰⁶, sive Motum Exhorrentr'ae Motus,
vocare licet. Per hunc motum terra stat mole sua ⁸⁷, mo-
ventibus se extremis suis in medium3 non ad centrum

⁸⁴ The word ‘agant,’ which occurs in the First Edition‚ should be
replaced by ‘agunt' as is done in the Second and Third Editions.

⁸⁵ Cp. Historia Densi et Rari, E. and S., vol. ii. p. 263 : ‘Pulsus cordis
et arteriarum in animalibus tit per irrequietam dilatationem spirituum, et
receptum ipsorum, per vices.' In reading vague and laneilul passages like
these, we must recollect that Harvey did not begin to teach his theory oi
the circulation ot the blood till 1619, and that it was not till 1628 that his
great treatise‚ the ‘Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in
Animalibus,' was published. Bacon might, it is true, have derived more
precise views than those which he expresses trorn earlier writers, but there
was nothing specially to direct his attention to this subject.

The Tides and the astronomical phenomena ot N utation and Libration
might fumish appropriate instances oi the ‘Motus Trepidationis.'

⁸⁸ Decubitus=lying away from, sc. motion. See F acciolati on decubo.
He quotes Fabius Pictor apud Aul. Gell. lib. x. cap. 13: ‘Pedes lecti, in
quo cubat [sc. Flamen Dialis], luto tenui circumlitos esse oportet: et de
eo lecto trinoctium continuum non decubat: neque in eo lecto cubare
alium fas est! Decubitus might, however, simply mean ‘lying down,’
‘redining,’ ‘reposo' (Cp. decumbo.)

On Bacon's vague and improper use of the word ‘motion,' see the first
note on this Aphorism. Here it cannot be rendered even by ‘process' or
‘operatiom’ but we must resort to some word of very wide meaning, such
as ‘tendency’ or ‘affection' of matter.

‘Inertia' the property of which Bacon here speaks, is simply the inca·
pacity of matter to change its own state oi rest or motion The obscure
notions os Bacon and his contemporaries about motion prevented them
lrom seeing that this property applies as much to the tendency ot a body
in motion to go on moving as to that of a body at rest to remain at rest.
For a briei account ot the establishment of the First Law οἰ Motion (which
seems to have been first enunciated by Galileo in 1638), see Whewell’s
ilistory oi the Inductive Sciences, vol. ii. bk. vi. ch. 2.

⁸⁷ Bacon seems never weary of parading his belief in the immobility oi
the earth.
