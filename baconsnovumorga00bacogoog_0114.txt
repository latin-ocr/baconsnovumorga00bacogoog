REACTION AGAINST ARISTOTLE. 85

sensata duce natura philosophati sunt: cum vera defensione Bemardi
Telesii. The Preface to this work, written in 1589, abounds in open
or covert attacks on Aristotle. Campanella's objections to the phi·
losophy of Aristotle were based as much on theological as on philoso
phical grounds. lna work entituled Disputatio in Prologum Instaura-
tarum Scientiarum ad Scholas Christianas, praesertim Parisienses, the
reader will find a very curious list of these theological objections.

M. A. Severinus⁹⁹ (b. 1580, d. 1656), a junior contemporary of
Bacon, aud, like Campanella, a follower of Telesius, was mainly a
writer of medical works. One of these is inscribed Antiperipatias,
hoc est adversus Aristotelem, de respiratione piscium, &o Like
Bacon, he attacks Aristotle for his treatment of the older Greek
Philosophers. Thus, he quotes with approbation the words of
Cabaeus‚ the last author on our list, when describing Aristotle as
‘adeo male meritus de antiquis, durn semper in pejorem sensum
interpretatur, ut proinde dignus esset, qui ab omnibus male
acciperetur, nec unquam ejus dicta ad bonurn sensum traherentur)

Nicolaus Cabaeus‚ a Jesuit, in his commentaries on the Meteoro l
logica of Aristotle, publislleuat Rome in 1646, constantly asserts that¹ ’
we should follow experiente and not Aristotle. But, at the same time,
he adopts a far more moderate tone than most of the writers whom
1 have hitherto noticed. Thus, in the Preface ‘Ad Lectorem’ he
states his position as follows: ‘Illud quidem affirmo, longe diversis
finibus contineri fidem et scientiam. Si Aristotelem volumus sapi-
entiae ducem, non abnuo: si doctrinae magistrum, non recuso: si
sapientiae parentem, agnosco in multis, maximisque rebus, et admiror :
si ad illius solum suffragium imus in sententiam, si in illius tantum
pronunciatis conquiescimus, et ejus dicta, absque alia probatione,
nobis sentiendi norma sunt, non admitto: imo dico, qui sic faciunt
longe ab Aristotelis doctrina recedere: qui vult illum esse Philo-
sophum, et illum sapientem, qui rerum causas noverit, non qui

. alicujus dicta memoriae consecravit!

These selections, which I have brought down to the time of Bacon
himself, will be sufficient to shew the nature and strength of the
reaction against the philosophy of Aristotle, From his more moderate
critics, or those who complained of the blind submission of his
followers rather than of the tone and method of the master himself,

⁹* This &trinus must not be confonuded with Ρ. Severinns the Daue, of whom
Bacon speaks in the Temporis Partus Masculus, in De Augmentis, iii. 4, aud pro·
bebly in Nor. Org. i. 116.
