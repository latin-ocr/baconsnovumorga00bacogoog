Etiam opera, quae jam inventa sunt, casui debentur et
experientiae ⁸, magis quam scientiis: scientiae enim, quas
nunc habemus, nihil aliud sunt quam quaedam concinna-
tiones rerum antea inventarum; non modi inveniendi, aut
designationes novorum operum.

sententiam ita claram, ut quasi digna sit cui propter se fides habeatur.
Alias axioma et propositionem sive sententiam quamlibet pro eodem is
habet: et recte quidem: ut enlm sententia a sentio, i.e. existimo wel
arbitror, ita axioma a verbo Graeco qnod idem significat, derivatur.
Atque hujus vocis generalem hanc significationem apud veteres Dialecticos
receptam fuisse, ex Cicerone, Plutarcho, Laertio, Gellio, Galeno lib. xvi.
c. 8etc. constat! Cicero, following the Stoics, appears iuvariably to use
the word in this sense. ‘Nempe fundamentum dialecticae est, quidquid
enuntietur (id autem appellant ἀξίωμα, quod est quasi effatum) aut verum
esse aut salsum! Acad. ll. 29. ‘Omne pronuntiatum (sicenim mihi in
praesentia occurrit, ut appellarem ἄξι’ωμα; utar post alio, si invenero
melius) id ergo est pronuntiatum, quod est verum aut falsum! Tusci. 7.
Bacon's usage oi the word seems to differ from thIs only ln restrIcting it
to general propositions, that is, ln excluding the ‘axioma particulare' and
the ‘axioma proprium¹ oI the Ramists.

The word is frequently restricted to seli-evident propositions, whether
common to all sciences, or peculiar to some particular science. Thus
Chauvin in his Lexicou philosophicum defines an Axiom as ‘sententia
generalis cuilibet attendenti nota,’ and we commonly speak ol truths,
which require no prool, as ‘axiomatic.¹

Newton’s use οἱ the word appears to be less general than that of Bacon.
Though he does not restrict it to sels-evident propositions, orto those
truths which are common to all sciences, he appears to use it exclusively
of the first principles ol any particular science. Thus, in the Prinpria,
he speaks οἱ the ‘Axiomata sire Leges Motus,’ and at the beginning ol the
Optics he enumerates five Axioms, such as that ‘The Angles of Refiexion
and Retraction lle ln one and the same Plane with the Angle οἱ Incidence,’
‘The Angle oI Refiexion is equal to the Angle ol Incidence,' etc. These
first principles would answer to the ‘Axiomata Generalissima’ of Bacon.

We have seen that Cicero proposes the word ‘pronuntiatum' as a
translation oi ἀξίωμα ln its more general sense, when used as the equi·
valent of proposition. The words ‘maxim’ ‘principle’ or ‘dignitas'
sometimes replace itin its more restricted senses.

The student will find a long note on the etymology and meaning oI
the word ‘Axiom' in Hamilton's edition os Reid, pp. 764-6.

⁸ ἐμπειρία, empiricism, mere experience‚ as distinguished Irom properly
directed observation and experiment. For a distinction between the
different kinds of experience and their bearing on discovery, see De
Augmentis, lib. v. cap. 2.
