alterantur3 ut cogitet simile quiddam etiam in natura rerum
universali fieri⁴⁵. Unde fluxit commentum illud elementorum,
atque illorum concursu ⁴⁶, ad constituenda corpora naturalia.
Rursus, quum homo naturae libertatem contempletur, incidit
in species rerum, animalium, plantarum, mineralium; unde
facile in eam labitur cogitationem, ut existimet esse in natura ’
quasdam formas rerum primarias, quas natura educere
molitur: atque reliquam varietatem ex impedimentis et aber·
rationibus naturae in opere suo conficiendo, aut ex diversarum
specierum conflictu, et transplantatione alterius in alteram,
provenire ⁴⁷. Atque prima cogitatio qualitates primas ele-
mentares⁴⁸, secunda proprietates occultas et virtutes spe-
cificas⁴⁰ nobis peperit; quarum utraque pertinet ad inania

⁴⁸ This error consists in supposing that all the processes of nature may
be explained by the idea oi Mechanical composition. On the confusion
between chemical and mechanical composition, the student may refer
to Mills Logic, ble iii. ch. 6. Hence, says Bacon,has arisen the fictionoi
elementary qualities. These were enumerated by the Peripatetics,iollow·
ing Aristotle, as hot and cold, dry and muist. The tour elements were
supposed to result from combinations of these elementary qualities, taken
two and two together. Thus fire is constituted by the combinationes bot
and dry; water by that oi cold and meist, and so on. Out os the lour
elements themselves, are composed the various natural bodies, as we
actually find thern.

Bouillet notices that, in the Thema Coeli (E. and S, vol. iit p. 777),
hardness and soltness are counted amongst the ‘elementary qualities!

⁴⁶ We must obviously read either concursus, or deque instead ot atque.

⁴' This is an excellent statement oi the hypothesis by which the Realists
attempted to account at once lor the permanente and variety in the forms
oi animal and vegetable lite. The ‘primary forms' or types were, ac·
cording to the strietest and most consistent school of Realists, supposed to
have existed prior to any of the individual objects in which they are
embodied. These types ‘natura educere molitur!

lt is, perhaps, superfluous to remark that, since the publication oi Mr.
Darwin's work on the ‘Origin oi Species’ the questions glanced at in
this paragraph have assumed, even amongst those who do not accept
Mr. Darwin’s hypotheses, au altogether different ionn and received an
altogether different solution from that which was formerly current.

⁴⁸ See note 43. All the remaining qualities oi bodies were called
secondary. This distinction is, oi course, quite different from that oi the
primary and secondary qualities ol bodies, as stated by Descartee, tocke,
and subsequent writers. See Hamilton on Reid, pp. 836-7.
