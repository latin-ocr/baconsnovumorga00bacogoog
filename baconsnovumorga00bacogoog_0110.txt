REACTION AGAINST ARISTOTLE. 81

Nizolius (b. 1498, d. 1566) in his ‘Anti-Barbarus Philosophicus t
sive Philosophia Scholasticorum impugnata⁸⁶,' first published in 1553, l
begins at once with an attack on the received mode of philosophising
and the inordinate importance attached to the works of Aristotle.
The received philosophy, he says, has only been able to maintain
itself through the rudeness of the times and the ignorance of men
‘qui quae a quibusdam antiquis et Graecis scriptoribus, ne dicam
nugatoribus, invenerunt tradita et literis consignata, ea omnia prorsus
temere ct sine ulla consideratione receperunt, receptaque approbave-
runt: perinde ac si essent oracula quaedam delphica, aut arcana
divinitus revelata, quae nullo pacto falsa esse possent! Not content
with this undiscriminating deference, they have made the Logic of
Aristotle as it were the door to all knowledge, and his Physics and
Metaphysics the steps as it were to the summit of wisdom. ‘Quae
omnia nos in toto hoc opere usque adeo falsa eta veritate aliena esse
sumus ostensuri, ut contra potius, qui per omnia in veritate investi·
ganda sequatur praecepta Pseudophilosophorum, et Aristoteli soli
ejusque doctrinae in philosophando sit addictus, is nunqnam nec
recte philosophari nec perfecte veritatem invenire possit ’ζ’ He
recommends, indeed, that the works of Aristotle should be frequently
read, ‘sed cum diligenti consideratione atque judicio,' and praises the
‘Ethics Politics, OEconomics, the Books on Animals, and Rhetorics’:
‘tamen affirmamus et contendimus non multo pauciora vel falsa, vel
inutilia, vel etiarn ridicula ab eodem scripta reperiri, ut in majori parte
librorum Naturalium, ac pene in totis Dialecticis, et non paucissimis
Metaphysicis’ He then applies to Aristotle's writings the proverb:
‘Ubi bene, nihil melius, ubi male, nihil pejus⁸¹.’ When he comes
to detail, his criticisms of Aristotle betray the same lrind of impatience
and asperity with which we are familiar in the works of Bacon.
The following may serve as one specimen out of many: ‘Quis nisi
mente captus hoe modo proprium assignaret? Sed Aristoteles, ut
librum magnum faceret, nihil praetermittebat, quamvis absurdum et
ridiculum ⁸⁰) At the end of the treatisew, there is an unsparing in-
vective against Aristotle, accompanied by an attack on Picus Miran-
dula and others for conlining their criticisms to the Commentators on

'⁸ The alternative title of this work is ‘ De reris principiis et vera ratione philo·
sophandi contra Pseudo-Philosophos.’ It was republished st Frankfort in1674,
with a preliminary dissertation by Leibnitz.
