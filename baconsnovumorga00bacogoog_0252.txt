tabile est ut sit aliquid extremum aut extimum mundi, sed
semper quasi necessario occurrit ut sit aliquid ulterius ⁷¹.

motto 01 Kant's Kritik der Reinen vernunst, which attempts to shew the
powerlessness 01 the human intellect in dealing with the ultimate pro·
blems 01 Metaphysics, while the attraction which they exercise on it is so
great, that it cannot 10110111 110111 attempting their solution.

This Aphorism touches on 0 number 01 philosophical difficulties which
it would be impossible within the limits ol 0 work like the present to dis-
cuss sully or satisfactorily. 1 shall confine· myself to 0111101 statement 01
my own opinions and to such references as 1 think likely 101100110οῙ use
to the student.

⁷¹ The mind is unable to think os the totality 01 space as finite ; 101, 01
whatever point we mentally place ourselves, we cannot but think 01 001110
001111 beyond it. Moreover, 11 space be finite, it must be bounded by some
figure, that is to say, the totality 01 space must, 011 this supposition, have
some shape 01 pther; hut, whether we regard it as spherical, cubical, or
01 any other shape, there must be some space beyond it 111 relation to
which it is said to be 01 this or that shape, and in which it is contained.
Hence, the proposition that Space (in its totality) is finite or bounded,
involves a contradiction in terms; 101 bounded space must have some
space beyond it. But, though we are thus compelled to think 01 space
as infinite, can we conceive infinite space? We certainly cannot realise,
imagine, or picture to ourselves infinite space, 101 11 would take an infinity
01 timeto 110 so. But this circumstance constitutes 110 valid reason why
we should 1011100 10 01111111 0 proposition, the only alternative 01 which has
been proved to 1100011-001111001101010. We are compelled, therefore, 10
000011 the proposition that Space is not finite, or, in other words, that
Space is infinite.

Similarly, we cannot think 01111110 00 having had a beginning, 101111011
there would be a time before time; 01 00 about to have an end, 101 111011
there would be a time 01101 111110. Ηο1100, we are compelled to affirm
an infinity 01 time, 00 we were before compelled to affirm an infinity 01
S ace.

Ρ1100111111011311 we are as little able to picture to our minds the process 01

- infinitesimal subdivision as that 01 infinite addition, we are compelled by

consideratione, similar to those which we have already gone through, to
affirm the infinite divisibility 01 both lines and matter. A line, however
small, must have two ends, and so be capable 01 1110001100; 011 atom must
have an upper and an under side, and so be capable 01 division.

The questions on which l have so briefly touched, and the very concep-
tion 01 infinity itsels, have been the occasion 01 much controversy. The
student, who wishes to acquaint himself with the main outlines 01 these
discussions, will do well to read the chapter on ‘ lnfinity’ 111 Locke’s
Essay (bk. ii. ch. 17); Kant's Kritik der Reinen Veniunft, Transcen-
dentale Dialektik, bk. 11. ch. 2 (Die Antinomie der Reinen Vemunft),
where the antinomies or contradictions connected with §ause and God
are discussed, as wellas those connected with Space, Time, and Matter;
