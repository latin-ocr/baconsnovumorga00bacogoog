206 NOVUM ORGANUM.

ut nil mirum sit, si ad nova particularia non'ducant ³¹. Quod

si sorte instantia ³² aliqua, non prius animadversa aut cognita,
se offerat, axioma distinctione aliqua frivola salvatur³³, ubi
emendari ipsum verius foret.

Rationem humanam, qua utimur ad naturam, anticipa-
timus νιαίιιναε34 (quia res temeraria est et praematura), at
illam rationem, quae debitis modis elicitur a rebus, interpre-
Ἴ tationem naturae, docendi gratia, vocare consuevimus.

³¹ The existing Amoms are founded on a small number of instances,
of common occurrence, and just fit those instances, but are employed as
if they were universally true, other instances to the contrary either not
being taken into account or being explained away by some frivolous dis·
tinction. ln other words, an empirica] law is employed as if it we're alaw
of causation. The student should read, in illustration of this Aphorism‚
Mr. Mill’s chapter on Empirical Laws (Mill's Logic, bk. iii. ch. 16). He
will also find some remarks on the same subject in my Inductive Logic,
ch. 4 (4th ed, pp. 220-222).

³² M. Bouillet draws attention to the fact that ‘instantia' is never used
in Classical Latin, in the sense of ‘an instance.¹ But 1 think he is wrong
in saying that it is here simply the English word ‘instance’ l= example)
latinised. Instantis (as a translation of ἔνστασις) was a technical term of
the schools, and, from the meaning of an ‘objection‚' which was generally
founded on a single case, would easily pass into that which it usually bears
in Bacon and in modern works generally. In this Aphorism, it seems to
retain the meaning oi ἔνστασις or objection.

³³ Thus, for instance, till the time of Galileo, it was held that bodiesfall
to the earth in times inversely proportional to their weights. But some
bodies, as, for example, flame, do not fall, but rise This exception was
accounted for by the principle of levity, according to which light bodies
tend upwards. The various current divisions of motion, such as natural
and violent motion, simple and compound motion, and the like, easily lent
themselves to frivolous distinctions of this kind.

The desire to patch up a theory by ingenious devices rather than to
review and emend it is well illustrated by the various contrivances of
epicycles and eccentrics by which the ancient astronomers endeavoured
to retain, in spite of all difficulties, the theory of the circular motion
of the heavenly bodies. Another assumption of the ancient astronomy
was that the heavenly bodies must be perfect spheres. When Galileo
discovered, by means of the telescope, the existence of cavities in the
moon, it was asserted, in reply, that they were filled with transparent
crystal.

³⁴ Called, in the last paragraph but one of the Preface‚ anticipationes
mentis. See p.188.
