²⁸ owing to the Plurallty ot causes, the ‘given nanre’ migne be

present without the other ‘nature’ even though this last was one oi the
causes capable ol producing it For it might nothe the only cause, and,
in this particular instance, the ‘given nature' might be due to some other
cause. Hence, the ‘rejection’ might be unwarranted.

On the Method oi Exclusions or Rejections generally, see Introduction,

⁷⁸ As a cause must produce its effect, unless there be some counter·

. acting cause, the ‘rejection,’ with this qualification‚ is warranted.

⁷¹ The same remarlr applies to this case as to the last.

⁷⁸ llere again, owing to the consideration ol the Plurality of Censes,
the ‘rejection’ might not be justified. Thus, the mortality ol a town
might increase, while a pestilente was diminishing, providing lamine,
nar, or any other cause oi death supervened.

The objection founded on Plurality oi Causes, ol course, only applies so
far as ‘Form’ is intended to express the same idea as Cause. There can
only be one ‘essence,' or, in the strict sense oi the tenns, only one ‘differ-
entia' (that is, sum ol characteristics) or ‘definitior’ ot* an objector
quality.

²‘ That is, provided all possible causes have been considered, and the
rejection has been so exhaustive, that only one cause remeius—conditions
which it is almost impossible to iulfil.
