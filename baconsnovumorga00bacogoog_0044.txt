school of English philosophy. As, however, I have discussed this
question in the sections on the Influence and Value of Bacon’s
writings, it is unnecessary that 1 should also dwell upon it here. It
may be enough to say that, like Socrates, he rather gave an impulse
and suggested lines of thought to others, than elaborated a definite
system of his own.

But, at the same time, it is interesting to ask what the opinions ol
Bacon were, sofar as we can gather them, on the controverted ques-
tions of psychology, ontology, and ethics. Now, as to what, for want
of a better name, may be called ontological or metaphysical questions,
the questions, namely, which relate to the origin and essential nature
of matter and mind, and the relation between the tvo, his ordinary
attitude is that ofa disinterested, if not a contemptuous, silence.
The passage just cited proceeds as follows: ‘Neque enim hoc agimus3
neque etiam multum interesse putamus ad hominum fortunas quales
quis opiniones abstractas de natura et rerum principiis habeat, neque
dubium est, quin multa hujusmodi et vetera revocari et nova introduci
possint; quemadmodum et complura themata coeli supponi possunt,
quae cum phaenomenis sat bene conveniunt, inter se tamen dissen-
tiunt! A deep sense of the unprofitable character of these specula·
tions has, indeed, beenacharacteristic not of the Baconian philosophy
only,but of British philosophy in generalwhich, withahealthy instinct,
has usuallyeither avoided them altogether or discussed them solely with
the view of shewing that they lie outside the limits of human knowledge.
An apparent exception is, perhaps, to be found in Bacon’s constant re
currence to the doctrines of the Atomists, as to the atoms and the void.
But these, properly speaking, are questions of physics rather than ol
metaphysica. On the standing feud between what are, somewhat
uncouthly, called the Idealists, the Materialists, and the Dualists, there
is, so far as 1 am avare, no formal discussion in Bacon's writings,
unless we count the passage in the De Principiis atque Originibus
(E. and S, vol. iii. p. 110), in which, quite sincerely as I believe, he
adopts the scriptural doctrine of creation out of nothing by the omni-
potent power of God. ‘Tria enim videntur esse dogmata quae
scimus en lide circa hanc rem. Primo, quod materia creata sit ex
nihilo. Secundo, quod eductio systematis fuerit per verbum omni-
potentiae, neque quod materia se ipsa eduxerit e chao in schema·
tismumillum. Tertio, quod schematismus ille (ante praevaricationem)
fuerit optimus exiis quae materia (qualis creata erat) suscipere posset
At philosophiae illae ad nullum horum adscendere potuerunt. '⁶ * **
In his itaque fidei atque ejus firmamentis standum!
