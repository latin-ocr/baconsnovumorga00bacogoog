stantiarum notarum, quae in eadem natura conveniunt, per

in a small volume, published at Leyden in 1638, entitled ‘Francisci de
Verulamio Historia Naturalis et Experimentalis De Ventis,’ dre. See
Introduction, ξ 17.

⁰⁰ That is, according to the actual order in which they present thern·
selves to the investigator in the course of his observations; not according
to any predetermined order. The order of arrangement must be deter-
mined after collection, when all the instances are before us3 otherwise, we
are in danger of overlooking altogether instances which may be material
to our enquiry.

⁶¹ De Remusat (Bacon, dic, p. 246) translates ‘forma calidi’ by nature
of heat. And this, perhaps, is the nearest equivalent (cp. the fourth
paragraph of Aph. 20, beginning ‘Intelligatur hoc,’ dre). But, as a know·
ledge of the nature of heat implies a knowledge of its cause and of the
law of its production, we may, in this instance, employ all three words
alilre in illustration of Bacon's use of the word ⁴ Fonn.'

⁶² The significance of these lnstances, as well as of the Tables which
occur in the following Aphorisms, may, perhaps, best be understood by
comparing them with the far more natural and scientific form which they
assume in Mr. Mill's ‘Experimental Methods.’ To assist the student in
this taslr, 1 extract the following passages from one of the notes in my
Inductive Logic (ch. 3, Appended Note 2, ath ed, pp. 207-10) :

‘lf the “Instantiae convenientes in natura calidi ’¹ were so related to
one another that, besides the given phenomenon (hest), only nne other
circumstance were common to them all, that other circumstance might be
regarded, with more or less probability, as the cause (or effect) of heat,
or, at least, as connected with it through some fact of causation. Such
instances would then come under the Method of Agreement.

‘lf one instance in the Table of Agreement (“ Instantiae convenientes
in natura calidi ”) were so related to one of the instances in the Table of
Privation (“lnstantiae in proximo, quae privantur natura calidi ’') as to
have every circumstance in common with it, except that the fonuer,
besides presenting the phenomenon of heat which is supposed io be
absent in the latter, also presented some other circumstance which was
absent from the latter, this other circumstance would be the cause (or
effect), ora necessary part of the cause, of heat. We should here have
the Method of Difference.

Ἥ, in the “Tabula graduum, sive comparativae in calido,” we could
discover some one phenomenon which increased and diminished propor-
