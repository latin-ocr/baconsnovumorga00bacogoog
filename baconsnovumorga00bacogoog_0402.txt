and ofl Cape Hom l do not recollect more than once having seen it so,
and then it was far from being brilliant. This circumstance probably has
a close connexion with the scarcity of organic beings in that part of the
ocean. After the elaborate paper by Ehrenberg, on the phosphorescence
of the sea, it is almost superfluous on my part to make any observations
on the subject. l may however add that the same torn and irregular
particles of gelatinous matter, described by Ehrenberg, seem, in the
southern as well as in the northern hemisphere, to be the common cause
of this phenomenon. ὓ * ὕ

‘Observing that the water charged with gelatinous particles is in an
impure state, and that the luminous appearance in all common cases is
produced hythe agitation of the tluid in contact with the atmosphere,
lam inclined to consider that the phosphorescence is the result of the
decomposition of the organic particles, by which process (one is tempted
almost to call it a kind of respiration) the ocean becomes purified!

Whether this conjecture be true or not, there can be no doubt that the
phosphorescence of the sea is often due to living organisms.

² Mr. Ellis remarks that this is ‘merely a translation of πνεύμων θαλάσ-
σιος, which is used by Dioscorides, De Materia Medica, ii. 39. The
luminous appearance arises apparently from serpent medusae, which in
texture are lilre the substance of the lungs, from which circumstance they
derive the name which Dioscorides gives them.'

‘The fire of St. Elmo, or Castor and Pollux, is a brilliant light which
frequently appears on the summits of ships' masts, on the points of
bayonets, on the tops of spears, and on the tips of the ears of horses

says, ‘we saw from different points of the ship about thirty St. Elmo's
