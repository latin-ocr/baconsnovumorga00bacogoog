differentiam motus naturalis et violenti⁵³, maxima cum
socordia, introducunt ; quae et ipsa omnino ex notione vulgari
est3 cum omnis motus violentus etiam naturalis revera sit,
scilicet cum externum efficiens naturam alio modo inopere
ponet quarn quo prius.

At hisce omissis; si quis (exempli gratia) observaverit,
inesse corporibus appetitum contactus⁵⁴ ad invicem, ut non
patiantur unitatem naturae prorsus dirimi aut abscindi, ut
vacuum detur: aut si quis dicat, inesse corporibus appetitum
se recipiendi in naturalem suam dimensionem vel tensuram ⁶⁵,
ut, si ultra earn aut citra eam comprimantur aut distrahantur,
statim in veterem sphaeram et exporrectionem suam se
recuperare et remittere moliantur: aut si quis dicat, inesse
corporibus appetitum congregationis ad massas connaturalium
auorum, densorum videlicet versus orbem terrae, tenuiorum et
rariorum versus ambitum coeli⁵⁶2 haec et hujusmodi vere

⁸³ Cp. Blr. ii. Aph. 48 (3), where the reader will see how far¹ Bacon
himself was from comprehending the true Laws oi Motion. The dis·
tinctiou ol Natural and Violent Motion willbe found, amongst many other
places, in Phys. iv. 8, v. 6, and viii. 4. All bodies in motion, Aristotle
conceived‚ naturallytend to rest, heavybodies‚asearth‚tendingdownwards,
and light bodies, as fire, tending upwards. This is Natural Motion. But,
it a body be in any way diverted from this natural motion, as, for instance,
when we throw a stone upwards, it is said to be moved violently or
unnuturally (βίᾳ or παρὰ φύσιν). Bodies, while moving in accordante
with nature, are said to seelr their own place. This distinctiones Natural
and Violent Motion is again criticised in ii. 36 (6) and 48 (7).

⁶⁴ This clause, as Dr. Kitchin says, embodies ‘a dim notion os attraction,
based on the old opinion as to Nature's abhorrence os a vacuum! lt is,
perhaps, needless to add that the fact os attraction os adhesion (ior it is to
this that Eacon appears to allude) has been established by subsequent
researches, whereas the theory that ‘Nature abhors a vacuum' has long
ago been exploded. On the latter theory and the experimenta which led
to its final abandonment‚ see herachel’s Discourse on the Study of Natural
Philosophy, ἐξ 244-246.

⁸³ This is obviously a description ot' the phenomenon of Elasticity.

θ’ Cp. ii. 48 (7). Bacon is peculiarly unfortunate in his illustration of the
notion of Affinity. The aggregation os bodies or rather particles which are
chemically homogeneous into large masses is an undoubted lact, but the
affinity of heavy things for the earth and of light things t'or the sky is a
mere fancy, implying the now exploded theory of absolute levity. Heavy
and light are, of course, only relative terms, and are better expressed
by more or less beavy; all bodies possessing weight, however various it
