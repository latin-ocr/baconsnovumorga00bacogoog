⁸² Towards this division we have a contribution in the tract printed
at the end oi the first edition of the Novum Organum, entitled ‘Parasceve,'
&c Bacon expressly says in the Introduction to it: ‘Huic autern rei locus
proprius foret quum ad Parasceuas Inquisitionis ordine deventum suerit.
Hoc vero praevertere, nec iocum proprium expectare, consultius nobis
videus!

⁸⁸ In Aph. 52, these Praerogativae Instantiarum are divided into such as
are eoncerued ‘cirea partem informativam’ (1-20, of which 1-15 ‘juvant
intellectum,’ 16-20 ‘ juvant sensum ’)‚ and such as are concerned ‘circa
partem operativam' (ar-27). For further subdivisions, see the Aphorism
itseli.

This portion nithe Novum Organum, it must be contessed, is defective
in arrangement, nor does it supply any systematic set oi rules for the
investigation of nature. 1t consists rather oi a miscellaneous collection
oi remarks, hints, and directions, many oi which are exceedinglyvaluable
and suggestae, though often expressed in ianciiul language and often
illustrated by exampies which we should now deem worthiess and un-
scientific. Oi Bacon's terminoIogy‚ however,l may remark that it has at
least been so felicitously selected, as in many cases to have leit a per·
manent mark on the language, as, ior example, in the expressions ‘Crucial
Instance,' ‘Glaring Instancess ‘clandestine Instauce,’ and the like.

In the Partis Secundae Delineatio (E. and S.,v01. iii. p. 556), the Prae·
rogatiwa instantiae together with the Praerogatiwa Inquisiti are described
as constituting the ‘inquisitionis contractio,' which has ior its office ‘ut
non tantum in inviis via, sed in viis compendium, et tanquam linea recta
quae per ambages et flexus secet, ex indiciis nostris innotescat! ‘itaque
docebimus primo,’ he goes on to say, ‘quales siut illae instantiae, sive
experimenta, quae ad illuminationem prae caeteris excellant, adeo ut
paucae idem quod aliae plures praestent. Hoc euim et moli ipsius his-
toriae, et discurrendi laboribus parcit!

⁸⁴ Bacon could hardly have commenced with amore promising example
ot his ‘ prerogatiwesl lt is curious that the two divisions os the ‘instantiae
solitariae' correspond respectively with Mill’s Methods oi Agreemeut and
Difference. To quote what 1 have said elsewhere (Inductiwe Logic, 4th
Ed, p. 147) : ‘In the Method oi Differeuce, the instances agree in every·
thing, except in the possession ol two circumstances which are presentia
theone instance and absent iu the other. ln the Method oi Agreement,
