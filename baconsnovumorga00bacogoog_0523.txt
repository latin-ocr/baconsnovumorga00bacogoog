Democritus also maintained that the moon is a solid body, and that the
marks on its face represent mountains and valleys.

⁴⁵ On these various discoveries, the last of which was also claimed by the
monlr Scheiner, see Delambre, Histoire de l'Astronomie blodeme, tome i.
liv. vi, and Mr. Drinlrwater's Life of Galileo, printed in the Library of
Useful Knowledge, above referred to; but specially the Sydereus Nnncins
of Galileo himself.

⁴⁰ Galileo's discoveries were often represented as mere optical delusione
The following amusing story is told of Scheiner (Baden Powell’s History
of Natural Philosophy, p. 171): ‘Scheiner was a monk; and, on communi-
cating to the superior of his order the account of the spots, received in
reply from that learned father a solemn admonition against such heretical
notions: “l have searched through Aristotle,” he said, “and can find
nothing of the kind mentioned: be assured, therefore, that it is a decep·
tion of your senses, or of your glasses.”’ One Lodovico delle Colombe
maintained that the apparently hollow parts of the moon were filled
with pure transparent crystal‚ to which Galileo replied that he would
gladly admit the theory, provided that, with equal courtesy‚ he was
allowed to raise on the smooth surface crystal mountains ten times higher
than those which he had ever seen and measured.

⁴⁷ These were astronomical instruments‚ used for the purpose of ‘taking’
or observing the stars. ‘The ancient astrolabe consisted of two or more
circles, having a common centre, and so inclined to each other as to enable
the astronomer to observe in the planes of different circles of the sphere at
the same time. For example, if the circles were at right angles, the
instrument would give both longitude and latitude, or the right ascension
