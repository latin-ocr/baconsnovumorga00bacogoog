⁵⁸ This principle is now known as that of the lndestructibility of Matter.
Parallel to it, if not identical with it, is the principle of the Conservation of
Energy. These laws are at once amongst the highest generalisations and
the most illuminating principles of Science. Mr. Bain gives an excellent
summary of the various aspects and consequentes ol the Principle of
Conservation of Energy in his lnductive Logic, rst Ed, p. 20, &a (cp.
p. 225, dcc.); but the student who wishes to see a precise and, at the same
time, a concise explanation of the principle in its relation to the recent
treatment of Physics (of which, indeed, it is the very foundation) should
consult Professor Balfour Stewart’s Elementary Treatise on Heat,
‘Remarks on Energy—Historical and Preliminary,' bk. iii ch. 1, 5th
Ed. pp. 314—328, or the Article on Energy in the last (9th) Edition of the
Encyclopaedia Britannica. By Professor Clerk hlaxwell the principle
has been stated as follows: ‘The total energy of any body or system of
bodies is a quantity which can neither be increased nor diminished by
any mutual action of those bodies, though it may be transformed into any
one of the forms of which energy is susceptible.’ The work of Sir W. R.
Grove (to which l referred in my First Edition) οτι the ‘Correlation of “
Physical F orces ' supplies some most interesting and instructive exemplifi-
cations of the transformation of the various forms of energy, one into
another.

These maxims in the vaguer and more general forms in which they
appear in the Novum Organum are of venerable antiquity. Thus Diogenes
Laertius (ix. 44), recounting the opinions of Democritus, says: μηδέν τε ἐκ
τοῦ μὴ ὄντος γίνεσθαι, μηδὲ tis τὸ μὴ ὃν φθείρεσθαι (cp. Plutarch, Adversus
Colotem, Ed. Reislce‚ vol. re p. 569). The same dictum is ascribed to
Diogenes of Apollonia (Diog. laert. ix. 57). Aristotle and others repeat it.
