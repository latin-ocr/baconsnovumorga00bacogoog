veniences of life, is another point in which, I think, Bacon profoundly
influenced succeeding generations. That his view was too exclusive,
and his language exaggerated‚ Ireadily own; but here again, as in
criticising the abuse of authority and imagination, it seems difficult
to deny that his influence was, on the whole, most beneficial. When
we recollect the frivolous character of many of the questions which
men of the most brilliant abilities were then in the habit of disputing,
and the profound misery or discomfort in which the mass of man-
kind, then even morethan now, was sunk, we can hardly feel surprise
or regret that a great statesman and a great philosopher should have
suggested the application of man’s intellectual endowments to the
improvement ‘of his material condition.

9th, Nor must we forget the hopefulness of Bacon as an important
clement in his influence. Men who despair of mankind and of the
future are, happily, seldom successful in persuading others to accept
their advice or their systems. There is a healthy instinct in man
which leads him to believe that the future will be better than the past,
and that the labours of the present generation will not be without
their effect in improving the condition of the next. No man was
ever inspired with this feeling more strongly than Bacon. He stood,
like a prophet, on the verge of the promised land, hidding men leave,
without regret, the desert that was behind them, and enter with
joyfulness and hopefulness on the rich inheritance that was spread
out before thern. The sixth part of the Great Instauration, to which
all the rest was subservient, the philosophy itself which was to be
the result of the right employment of the method, he hoped only to
begin. ‘The fortune of the human race,’ he says, ‘will give the
issue 5—such an issue, it may he, as in the present condition of things
and of the minds of men cannot easily be conceived or imagined.
For the object in view is not only the contemplative happiness, but
the whole fortunes‚ and affairs, and powers, and works of men ⁶²!
· roth, To all these sources of influence we must add the marvellous
language in which Bacon often clothes his thoughts. His utterances
are not infrequently marked with agandeur and solemnity of tone,
a majesty of diction, which renders it impossible to forget, and
difficolt even to criticise them. He speaks as one having authority,
and it is impossible to resist the magic of his voice. Whenever he
wishes to he emphatic, there is the true ring of genius about all that
he says. Hence, perhaps, it is that there is no author, unless it be
