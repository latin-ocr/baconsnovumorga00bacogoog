LIB. II. 12. 371

accensa⁹⁰, quam esse naturae igneae fortioris. Sed de hoc
inquiratur ulterius.

eda-²9¹· Sunt quaedam coruscationes⁹¹ quae praebent lumen
sed non urunt; eae vero semper fiunt sine tonitru.

Λᾶν· ¹0¹. Eructationes et eruptiones flammarum inveniuntur
non minus in regionibus frigidis quam calidis3 ut in islandia
et Groenlandia: quemadmodum et arbores per regiones srigi·
das magis sunt quandoque inflammabiles et magis piceae ac
resinosae quam per regiones calidas; ut fit in abiete, pinu,
et reliquis: verum in quali situ et natura soli hujusmodi erup-
tiones fieri soleant, ut possimus affirmativae subjungere nega·
livam, non satis quaesitum est ⁹².

naa-11⁸. Omnis flamma perpetuo est calida magis a‘ut
minus ⁹³, neque omnino subjungitur negativa.- et tamen rel ·
runt ignem satuum⁹⁴ (quem vocant), qni etiam aliquando
impingitur in parietem, non multum habere caloris3 fortasse
instar flammae spiritus vini, quae clemens et lenis est ⁰⁵. Sed

⁰³ This opinion probably arose from their pean-like shape as they dart
across the heavens, and from the manner in which they appear to be
suddenly kindled and then again suddenly extinguished ln reality,
these aerolites usually consist mainly ol metallic iton, the rest ol their
substance being made up of a variety ol other metals.

⁹¹ Sheet-lightning. This phenomenon occurs when the discharge of
electricity takes place below the horizon, or behind a dense cloud, or
at great elevatione above the earth’s surlace. On these occasions, the
distance is too great or the intervening obstacle too dense for the thunder
to be heard.

⁸² We must recollect that, at this time, not even the conception ol a
science ol geology had boen formed. lt is needless to say that volcanoes,
hot springs (see below), and similar phenomena have no connexion what·
ever with tbe temperature ol the surface ol the soil.

⁹³ The temperature ol a flame depends on the nature ol the substance
burnt and on the nature ol the medium in which the combustion takes place.
For the relation between the heat and luminosiry ol different kinds offlame,
see the article on Combustion in Watts’ Dictionary ol Cbemistry.

⁹⁴ ‘Willso‘ the Wisp.’ This phenomenon probably arises lrom the
escape ol marsh gas (light carburetted hydrogen) lrorn the earth at night·
time, when a saint light is easily visible. How the gas becomes ignited,
it is sometimes difficult to say. A frequent cause ol its ignition‚ probably,
is contact with phosphoretted hydrogen.

⁸⁸ As Dr. Kitchin says, ‘the liame ol spirits oswine, instead ol being
“clemens et lenis,” is one ol the most intensely hot kinds of dame!
llacon was probably deceived by the appearance.
