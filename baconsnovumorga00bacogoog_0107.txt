He then goes on to complain that ArIstotle's demonstrations are
either circular or proceed from occult and unknown properties. ln
the preceding chapter (De Rhetorica) the old charge of impiety is ⁵
renewed against the Aristotelians, while the Platonists are, as sub
sequently by Bacon, accused of superstition: ‘Et qui Aristoteli et
Platoni impensius student, fiunt illi quidem superstitiosi, hi vero impii)

Ludovicus VIves (b. 1492, d. ¹540) wasa Spaniard by birth,
· though he spent the greater part of his life in France, England⁷⁹, and
Belgium. ln his book entitled ‘De Causis Corruptnrum Artium’ he
frequently alludes to Aristotle. Generally speaking, he extols him,
, but enlarges on his great obscurity, rendered still more obscure by
the bad literal translations then in vogue. He notes contradictions
in his philosophy, but allows that these are almost unavoidable. ln one
place, he offers a curious explanation of Aristotle's obscurity. He had
so bitterly attached his predecessors that he feared retaliation from his
successors, and therefore purposely made his language ambiguous, ln
order to baffle opposition. ‘Ea res’ (namely Aristotle’s misrepresen·
tation of the opinions of the older philosophers) ‘non solum veras
antIquorum sententias nobis ademit, quae fortassis jactura fuisset
tolerabilis, verum, quod est gravius, Aristotelem nobis timidiorem
effecit ad eloquendum quae sentiret, reputantem scilicet quod est ln
mimo: Ab alio expectes, alteri quod recensu) Aristotle’s treatment
of his predecessors is tumed into an argument for subjecting his
own opinions to examination. ‘Quid Aristoteles lpse, an non supe
riorum omnium placita convellere est ausus? nobis examInare saltem
accensere nefas erit? praesertim quod, ut Seneca sapienter dicit, qui
ante nos ista moverunt, non domini nostri, sed duces sunt. Patet
