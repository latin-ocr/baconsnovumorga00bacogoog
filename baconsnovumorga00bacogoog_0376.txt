Qui causam alicujus naturae (veluti albedinis aut caloris) in
certis Π tantum subjectis novit3 ejus scientia imperfecta est:
etqui effectum super certas tantum materias (inter eas, quae

sunt susceptibiles) inducere potest; ejus potentia pariter im-
perfecta est. At qui efficientem et materialem causam ¹⁸ tan·
tummodo novit (quae causae fluxae sunt, et nihil aliud quam
vehicula et causae formam deferentes in aliquibus ¹⁹), is ad

, nova inventa, in materia aliquatenus simili et praeparata, per·

venire potest3 sed rerum terminos altius fixos non movet.
At qui formas novit, is naturae unitatem in materiis dissi·
millimls complectitur²⁰; itaque quae adhuc facta non sunt,

with reference to the ‘forms' of the ‘simple natures’ themselves. The
allusion would then be to the several differentiae which constitute, or
the several conditions out of which is produced, the given nature, such,
for instance, as those enumerated in Aph. 20.

lt will be noticed that Bacon here employs the word ‘Form’ in a
different sense (namely, the signification appropriated to it by himself)
from that in which be employed it in the last sentence but one, where he ·
condemned the position assigned to Forms.

¹² ‘Certain’ in the sense of ‘ parricidar!

¹⁸ The Efficient and Material Canses seem here to be spoken of only
in reference to concrete substantes, while the Forms which Bacon has
in view in this Aphorism are those of ‘simple natures‚' such as heat or
whiteness. Now be who knows the material and efficient causes of any
given substance may be able to produce or modify other substances of
a similar character, but his power will extend no further. Bothe, on the
other band, who is acquainted with the form, law, or cause of a ‘simple
nature,' such as beat or whiteness‚ will be able to produce it in substances
nithe most dissimilar kind.

¹⁹ ln particular substances only. Ήιο meaning is that the Efficient and
Material Causes vary as we pass from one substance to another (fluxae
sunt), and convey or embody the form in certain cases only. ln other
cases, a different efficient cause might be necessary to convey, or a dif-
ferent material cause to embody, the same form. For the sense in which
the word ‘fluxae’ is used, cp. Bk. i. Aphs. 16, 51, and note on Bk. i.
Apb. ιι.

’⁰ Thus, if we knew the Law of the development of Heat, we should be
ableto produce beat in any substance whatever. This scientitic know·
ledge of law is here contrasted with the merely empirical knowledge of
the artisan, wbo, being acquainted with certain substances only, ean pro-
