Necesse prorsus est ut iste motus efficiatur, vel ab aquarum
progressu et regressu, in modum aquae in pelvi agitatae⁷⁸, quae,
quando latus unum pelvis alluit, deserit alterum3 vel a sub-
latione et subsidentia aquarum e profundo, in modum aquae
ebullientis et rursus subsidentis ⁷⁹. Utri vero causae fluxus

globum lunae et aquas maris (quae maxime credibilis videtur in fluxibus
et refluxibus semi-menstruis).' The semi-menstmal and semidiurnal
pbenomena of the tides were at this time frequently explained on
distinct principles.

τ’ This view was maintained by Galileo. See Dialogi dei Massimi
Sistemi, Giomata iv. lle refers the alternate ebb and how of the waters
to the composition of the annual and diurnal motions of the earth. ‘lt
being therefore presupposed that there are such contrarieties of motions in
the parts of the terrestrial surface, whilst it tumeth round upon its own
centre, it is necessary that, in conjoyning this diurnal motion with the
other annual, there do result an absolute motion for the parts of tbe said
terrestrial superficies, one while very acoelerate, and another while as slow
again. 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 We will conclude, therefore, that like as it
is true the motion of the whole globe, and of each ol its parts, would be
equal and uniforme, in case they did move with one single motion,
whether it were the meer annual or the single diumal revolution, so it is
requisite that, mixing those two motions together, there do result thence
for the parts of the said globe irregular motions, one while accelerated, and
another while retarded, by means of the additions or subtractions of the
dlumal conversion from the annual circulation. So that, if it be true
(and most true it is, as experience proves) that the acceleration and re·
tardation of the motion of the vessel makes water contained therein
to run to and again the long wayes of it, and to rise and fall in its
extreames, who will make scruple of granting that the said effect may,
nay ought to succeed in the sea-vatem, contained within their vessels,
subject to such like alterations, and especially in those that distend them-
selves long-wayes from West to East, which is the course that the motion
of those same vessels steereth? Now this is the most potent and primary
cause of the ebbing and flowing, without the which no such effect would
ensue.’ Sir Thomas Salusbury's Translation‚ pp. 389-390. See F lorence
Ed. of 1842, vol. i. pp. 462-4. The idea that the tides are due to the
influence of the moon is alluded to and ridiculed by Galileo a few pages
above. See p. 455 (Sir Thomas Salusbury's Translation‚ p. 383). lt is
noticed by Mr. Ellis (E. and S, vol. iii. p. 44) that Galileo’s theory was
first propounded in a letter to Cardinal Orsino, dated 1616. This letter
is to be found in the F lorence Edition of Galileo's Worles, vol. ii. pp.

⁷⁹ From what follows, it is plain that Bacon, had he adoptedthis altema-
tive, would have explained it hya magnetic force, attracting the waters.
But, as Mr. Ellis says (E. and S, vol. iii. p. 41), ‘One theory, that of
