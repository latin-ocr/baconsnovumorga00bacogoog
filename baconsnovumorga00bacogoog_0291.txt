262 NOVUM ORGANUM.

derunt, non multa aut magni momenti sunt: et qualiacunque
sint, lundata sunt super basin eorum quae inventa sunt a
Graecis. Erat autem sapientia Graecorum professoria, et in
disputationes effusa⁸⁴: quod genus inquisitioni veritatis
adversissimum est. Itaque nomen illud sophistarum ⁸⁵, quod
per contemptum ab iis, qui se philosophos haberi voluerunt,
in antiquos rhetores rejectum et traductum est, Gorgiam,

Romans might, at least, bave been credited with the mechanical skill
which enabled them to construet such magnificent reads, aqueducts,
bridges, amphitheatres, dcc, and the Arabiane (even ii Bacon despised the
share they had in reviving the study ol the Aristotelian philosophy in
Europe) with their part in the inventiones our present numerals and of
the science oi Algebra, with the discovery oi distillation, with their con-
tributions to the science of medicine, with the first essays at a science oi
chemistry, &c In the desire to lay the foundations ol a new method and
a new body oi science, there can be no question that Bacon was disposed
to undervalue what had already been achleved Towards the ‘recen-
tiores' he assumes a lairer tone in Aph. 109.

⁸⁴ ln this tendency to questioning and disputation‚ however, originated
philosophy and abstract speculation. The Hindoos and Greeks alone,
in the ancient world, appear to have possessed such a tendency in any
marked degree. Without it, poetry, practical inventions, and maxims ol
conduct are possible, but not philosophy, or, to any great extent, even
scientific theory.

⁸⁶ The following sentences are remarkable, as containing a view os the
Sophists which bas now been rendered familiar to English readers by the
works ol Mr. Lewes aud Mr. Grote. ln pointing out the original appli-
cation of the term ‘ Sophists' to all philosophers indifferently, iu glancing
at the connexion between the Sophists properly so called and the Rhetors,
and in speciiying the wandering lile and the taking ol sees as the charac-
teristics mainly distinguishing the Sophists so=called from the philoso-
phers so·called, Bacou undoubtedly anticipates some oi the principal
points lor which Mr. Grote contends.

Cp. a similar passage in the Redargutio Philosophiamm (E. and S.,
vol. iii. pp. 565-6), where he ranks Plato and Aristotle amougst the
Sophists, distinguishing lavourably from them Empedocles, Heraclitus,
Democritus, Anaxagoras, and Parmenides: ‘Neque enim reperietis hos
scholas aperuisse, sed tandem speculationes et inventa sua in scripta
redegisse, et posteris transmisisse! Of Plato and Aristotle he says: ‘ltaque
non haesitabo apud vos dicere, me locum Platoni et Aristoteli tribuere
inter Sophistas: sed tanquam ordinis emendati et reformati. Eandem
enim rem prorsus video. Aberat sortasse loci mutatio et circumcursatio,
et mercedis indignitas, et inepta ostentati03 atque lucet in illis certe
quiddam solennius et nobilius ; sed aderant schola, auditor, secta. ltaque
genus ipsum profecto cernitis!
