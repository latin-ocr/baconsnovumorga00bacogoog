Without some explanation of this definition, Bacon's criticism is unintel-

ligible, and, bearing in mind the account, given in note 86 on Aph. 51, οἰ
the technical terms ἐνέργεια and ἐντελέχεια, this explanation may easily be
supplied.

The lileless body, as, ior instance, the embryo, maybeoegardedascapable
ol lil'e. lt attains its actuality, as soon as it begins to live. Thus, ψυχή is
the actual manifestation (ἐντελέχεια) oi that lile which every organized
body has potentially. But why ἦ upum? We must recolleet that δύναμιν
and ἐνέργεια or ἐντελέχεια are purely relative terms; what is a δύναμιν in one
relation may be an ένέρχεια or ἐντελέχεια in another. Now ψυχή, as we
have seen, is the ε’νέργεια or ἐντελέχεια of σῶμα, but ψυχή, when once
manifested, begins to perform various functione (such as, in the case ot
man, are perception, thought, διο). These acts or iunctione are them·
selves ἐνέργειαι, oi which ψυχή, in its donnant state, may be regarded as
the δύναμις. Hence, while the manifestatione of ψυχή are, as it were,
δεύτεραι ε’νίργειιιι, ψυχή itsell' is a πρῶτη ε’νέργειιι.

That the technical terms of which the definition oi ψυχή is composed
represent ‘second intentions’ or ‘second notions’ is plain enough. The
student, who is not acquainted with the distinction between ‘first' and
‘second' notions, should refer to Sir W. Hamilton's Essay on Logic
(Discussions, p. 139) or Dr. Mansel's edition oi Aldrich's Logic, cap. 1. ξ 3.
div. 8, note. lt is possible, however, that Bacon rnay use the phrase in its
later sense, as employed by Aldrich and others, in which case it is equally
applicable to the terms oi the definition criticised.

Bacon is here probably referring to a passage in the Physics, iv. 5 (6)
[p. 213 a. 1-4] : οὗτοι di rol α’ὴρ ἔχει πρὸς ὕδωρ’ oiov ὕλη γάρ, τὸ δ’ εἶδος, τὸ
μὲν ὕδωρ ὕλη ἀέρος, ό δ’ ἀὴρ οἶον ἐνέργειά rar ἐκείνου· τὸ ydp ὕδωρ δυνάμει ἀήρ
ε’στιν, ὅ δ’ riiyp δυνάμει ὕδωρ ἄλλον τρόπον. Water is regarded as condensed
air, and airas rarelied water, and, therefore, either may, in a certain
sense, be regarded as being the other potentially. ‘Actus ’ and ‘ potentia'
os course, correspond respectively with ε’νέργεια and δύναμιν.

Mr. Ellis in his Pret'ace to the Historia Densi et Rari (vol. ii. pp. 236-7)
refers to another passage in Aristotle (Categ. ch. 8. p. toa. 1d24), where
the dense and the rare are explained as due to different modes os the dis·
position os particles, the particles in dense bodies being near one another,
and inrarebodies standingsurther apart.

²³ This is an allusion to the Scholastic distinction oi ‘Motus Pro
prius' and ‘Motus Alienus! All bodies were supposed to have some one
motion, and one motion only, proper to them. But, in addition to this
motion, they might participate in one or more other motions communicated
to them by other bodies. Thus, t'or instance, the wheel oi a watch has
a proper motion ol one kind only, but, besides this, it may share in the
