Ex duobus generibus axiomatum, quae superfus posita
sunt ⁵¹, oritur vera divisio philosophiae et scientiarum trans-
latis vocabulis receptis (quae ad indicationem rei proxime
accedunt) ad sensum nostrum. Videlicet, ut inquisitio sor·

natures. 1t shews, as l have pointed out elsewhere, that he regarded the
‘simple natures’ as constituting a sort of alphabet, and that he supposed
that, if we only possessed a complete knowledge of this alphabet, we
should be ableto explain and reproduce nature in all her complexity.

⁴⁹ Cp. i. 96 and note 75 on that Aphorism. The meaning of the pas·
sage in the text, when taken in connexion with the context, is somewhat
doubtful. lt may refer generally to the deductive branches of natural
philosophy, stated and worked out mathematically (as l believe is the
case with the passage in i. 96), or (as the context would rather lead us to
suppose) it may have a more special reference. ln the latter case, it
probably contemplates the application of mathematics to the enumerando,
mensuration, and determination of the form of tbe ultimate particles of
matter; or possibly it may have reference to the combination of ‘simple
natures’ in concrete substantes, mathematics being applied to determine
the number of such ‘simple natures' which are to be found in any given
substance, or are requisite to its productiori, and, perhaps, also the several
proportions in which they are combined.

³⁰ This sentence does not appear to mean more than that in Mathema-
tics we may have to deal with very largeur very small quantities. There
may possibly bean allusion to a cutinus passage in the Republic of Plato
(bk. vii. p. 525 E), where Socrates says that the arithmetician will not
tolerate fractionS, but insists on multiplying them back again into in·
tegers.

‘³ ‘Meaning’ says Mr. Ellis, ‘that God could change them, but that
this change would be above reason and a change of the law of the form,
otherwise unchangeable’

⁶³ Cp. De Augmentis, iii. 4. There he includes the investigation of
Final Causes under Metaphysic. Here, as they stand in no relation to
the present discussion, he omits all mention of them.

It is, perhaps, needless to observe tbat this is a special aud arbitrary
