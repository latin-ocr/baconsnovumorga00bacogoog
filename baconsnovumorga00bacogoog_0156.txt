NATURE OF BACON’S INFLUENCE ΟΝ SCIENCE. 127

in freely and partake of the feast. In one word, he popularised the
study of nature.

and, He insisted, both by example and precept, on the importance
of experiment as well as observation. Nature, like awitness, when
put to the turture, would reveal her secrets. Experimentation was
undoubtedly common in Bacon's time, but it was generally associated
with the Alchemists‚ and so, while it suffered in reputation‚ it was
confined in range. Bacon gave it an extension, a dignhy, a popu·
larity which, it is not too much to say, must have materially intluenced
the labours of the Royal Society, and the crowning efforts of Boyle
and Newton.

3rd, In both these ways, Bacon recalled men to the study of facts,
and though, in the first instance, he had mainly in view the facts of
external nature, the influence of his teaching soon extended itself, as
he undoubtedly purposed that it should do, to the facts of mind,
conduct, and society. 'lhe inductive study of Mental, Moral, and
Political Philosophy, which has been the distinctive characteristic of
the best English thought from the end of the seventeenth century
onvards, is, it seems to me, no less really, though I grant it is less
obviously, a result of the Baconian reaching than the inductive study
of Natural Philosophy.

4th, In order to set men free to study facts, it was necessary to
deliver thern froin the pemicious subjection to authority, to which they
had so long been enslaved. Here and there throughout the Middle
Ages, a solitary thinker, like Roget Bacon, may have asserted his
independence, and, during the century preceding Bacon’s time, the
murmurs of discontent had been becoming loud and frequent, but it
required a clear, shrill voice, like that of the author of the Great
Instauration, effectually to awaken men from their slumber. Bacon
seems to have been thoroughly impressed with the feeling that there

was no hope for human fortunes, unless these bonds could be broken;
and hence the tone of intended and conscious exaggeration with

which he often sets about this taslr, as is especially the case in the
Temporis Partus Masculus and some parts of the Novum Organum.
Nor can 1 doubt that his utterances on this subject had far more
influence in producing the intellectual revolution which followed than
the utterances of any one of his predecessors, or, perhaps, than those
of all taken together. It would hardly, Ithink, be an exaggeration to
compare Bacon, in the intellectual sphere, with Luther, in the sphere
of religion. And, in truth, there was much in common between the
two men. Both ol them were intensely impressed with the importance
