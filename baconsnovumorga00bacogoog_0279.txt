ribus, et virtutibus specificis) illa altera (quae recte notata

telians gave the name of Occult qualities not to manifest qualities, but
to such qualities only as they supposed to lie hid in bodies, and to be
the unknown causes of manifest effects: such as would be the causes of
gravity, and of Magnetic and Electric attractions, and of fermentations,
if we should suppose that these forces, or actions, arose from qualities
unknown to us, and incapable of being discovered and made manifest.
Such Occult qualities puta stop to the improvement of Natural Philosophy,
and therefore of late years have been rejected. To tell us, that every
species of things is endowed with an occult specific quality, by which it
acts and produces manifest effects‚ is to tell us nothing: but to derive two
or three general principles of motion from phaenomena, and afterwards
to tellus how the properties and actions of all corporeal things follow
from those manifest principles, would bea very great step in philosophy,
though the causes of those principles were not yet discovered: and there·
fore 1 scruple not to propose the principles of motion above-mentioned, they
being of very general extent, and leave their causes to be found out.’

The conceptions of ‘occult properties’ and ‘specific virtues’ belong
to that stage of speculation in which men believed that the properties
of objects were distinct entities, separable, as it were, from the objects
themselves, and dwelling in them. ln a still prior stage of speculation,
these properties bad been personified aod regarded as divine. See
Mommsen’s History of Rome, bk. i. ch. 12 (Dickson’s Translation, vol. i.
pp. 171—3), and Tylor's Primitive Culture, ch. 15 (vol. ii. first ed.
pp. 220-223, second ed. pp. 242-246).

⁶⁰ ‘lnspissandi stands over against Attenuandi; its meaning being
“condensation.'' lt does not occur in [classical] Latin writers! (Dr.
Kitchin's note.)
