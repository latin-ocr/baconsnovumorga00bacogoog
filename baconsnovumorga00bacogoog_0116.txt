ANTICIPATIONS OF BACON'S DOCTRINES. '87

account of Aristotle’s method, so far as it relates to the present
question

To my mind nothing can be clearer than that Aristotle bases all
evidence ultimately on the observation of individual facts. See, for
instance, Memphi. 1, Post. Aa. ii. 19. And, in accordance with this
doctrine, the ultimate major premiss of any train of deductiwe
reasoning must itself rest on an induction from particulare. Ἐκ
προγινωσκομέυωυ δέ πᾶσα διδασκαλία, ὥσπερ καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἀναλυτικοῖς λέγομεν·
ἡμὲν γὰρ δι’ ἐπαγωγῆς, ἡ δὲ συλλογισμῷ. Ἦ μὲνδὴ ἐπαγωγὴ ἀρχή ἐστικαὶ
τοῦ adultum de* συλλογισμὸς ἐκ τῶν καθόλου. Εἰσὶν ἄρα ἀρχαὶ ἐξ twa ’
συλλογισμόο,’ὧν οὐκ ἔστι συλλογισμός· ἐπαγωγὴ ἄρα. Eth. NiC. vi. 3 (3).
Ἀδύνατον δὲ ed καθόλου θεωρῆσαι μὴ δι’ ἐπαγωγῆς· ... ἐπαχθῆναι δὲ μὴ
ἔχωσας αἴσθησιν ἀδύνατον· τῶν γὰρ καθ ἕκαστον ἡ αἴσθησις. An. Post.
‘u 18. Unfortunately, Aristotle went no further in his formal analysis
of induction than to reduce it to the syllogistic type, and, as an
almost necessary consequence of this procedure, he regarded an
exhaustive enumeration of all the instances (Inductio Completa)
as its typical form. Δεῖ δὲ νοεῖν sd 1· τὸ ἐξ ἁπάντων τῶν καθ ἕκαστον
συγκείμενον· ἡ ylp ἐπαγωγὴ διὰ πάντων. An. Pr. ii. 23. But, as, in
most cases, it was impossible to satisfy this requirement in practice',
we find him, as a matter of fact, selecting his instances, and that often
with great skill⁸, though sometimes, it must be confessed, with much
carelessness. (On this and other points connected with Aristotle’s
method, cp. ξ 11 of this Introduction.) Some of his remarks on the
proper examination of facts or theories are characterised by great

³ He does not always insist on it, eren theoretioelly. See An. Post. i. 31· p. sta.
4-5; Top. viii. 8. p. 160. b. 3.

⁸ Ueberweg (System der Logilr) rightly calls attention to De Partibus Anima-
lium, ir. ο (677 a 3o-b r), as shewing that Aristotle was awsre, in practice, of
the importanoe of having regard to cansal connexion in framing onr generalisstions.
'l'he chapter is also interesting as effording examples of the ‘ negative instances' to
which Bscon attaches so much importunae. At the same time, itis remarkable
for the carelessness of obsemtion which lt displays.

My friend Mr. J. asservarent Christ Church hss drawn my attention to s re·
markable correspondenoe between some of the loci in Topics, ii. 10, 11, and the
cenons of reasoning ln modern Inductire Logic. The passage is worth more
attention then it hss received.

It may here be notioed that Aristotle also recognises sn imperfect form of in·
duction, in the παράδειγμα or ἐπαγωγὴ ῥητορική. See Αα. Pr. ii. ²4·

‘l’he student, who wishes to obtain a clear ides of Aristotle's doctrine of ln·
duction, will do well to compare the following passages: An. Pr. ii. ²3, 24; An.
Posti 1‚²‚3,18‚31‚il·5,19; Top. l.1a,ii. 10, rr, viii. r, 2,8; Memphi r;
De Pert. An. ἰν. ος Eth. Nic. vi. 5 (3), 11 (4-6).
