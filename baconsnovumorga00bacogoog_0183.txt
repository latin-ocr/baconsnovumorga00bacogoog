can now dispense with the five volumes, containing the Philosophical
Works with prefaces and notes, to which such frequent reference is
made in the subsequent pages of this edition.

Ueber Baco’s von Verulam wissenschaftliche Principien von A.
Lusson. Berlin, 1860. [This short tract is, to my mind, the most
effective of all the attacks on the Baconian philosophy. It must,
I think, have suggested to Liebig the onslaught which he made three
years subsequently, but it is far more moderate and elevated in tone
than is his diatribe, and shews afar more intimate acquaintance both
with Bacon’s doctrines and with the history of philosophy in general]

Ueber Francis Baton von Verulam und die Methode der Natur-
forschung, von Justus von Liebig. Miinchen, 1863. [This disquisi-
tion is written in a tone of shrill invective, almost as if Bacon were a
personal enemy of the writer. See, for a further account ol it, ξ 16
of this Introduction. Liebig was himself so well satisfied with his
performance, that he published it also in an English form, in
Macmillan’s Magazine (July and August, 1863). It has been
translated into French, and published with some notes and addi·
tions, by M. De Tchihatchef, Paris, 1866 (2¹⁸0 Ed, 1877).]

A large part of Franchi's Letture su la Storia della Filosofia
Moderna, Milano, 1863, is devoted to Bacon. [The estimate of him
as a reformer of method and science is, on the whole, unfavourable.]

Liebig’s work produced a lively controversy in Germany. He was
answered by Heinrich Biihmer, in a work entitled Ueber Francis
Bacon von Verulam, dcc, Erlangen, 1864 3 and also by Sigwart
of Tiibingen. Sigwart attacked Liebig's work in the Preussische
Jahrbiicher of 1863, S. 93, &c To this criticism Liebig replied in
the Allgemeine Zeitung‚ Nov. 2-7. Sigwart made his rejoinder in
the Preussische Jahrbiicher of 1864, S. 79, &e Liebig again replied
in Allg. Zeit, March 4-7. M. De Tchihatchef has translated Liebig’s
papers in his ‘Lord Bacon,’ tte.. but they add little of what is new
to the original pamphlet.

A similar and independent controversy, though 011 a much smaller
scale, was carried on in France, in 1866. Μ. Claude Bernard
(Introduction a la medecine experimentale, Paris, 1866) attacked
Bacon's claims as a Reformer of Science, and was answered by M.
Paul Janet in the Revue des Deua-Mondes of April 15, 1866.

Ueber Bacon von Verulam, besonders vom Medicinischen Stand-
punkte, von Dr. H. von Bamberger. Wiirzburg, 186 5.

De Baconis Baronis de Verulamio Philosophia scripsit Augustus
Domer. Berlin, 1867.
