⁷* With certain exceptions (which are enumerated in my Inductive Logic,
4th ed, pp. 7-9), the detection ol a law ol Causation can alone warrant us
in founding a general conclusion on our observations and experimenta. '
On the distinction between Laws ol Causation and Empirical Laws,
which are ‘unfit to be relied on beyond the limits oi time, place, and
circumstance, in which the observations have been made,' see Mill's Logic,
bk. iii. ch. 16. Mr. Mill, however, uses the expression ‘Empirical Laws'
somewhat loosely.v lt would be better to confine it entirely to those
secondary laws which are the result of an Inductio per Enumerationem
Simplicem as distinguished from the results given by the Inductive
Methods, in which there is always some evidence of facts of causation.
See my Inductive Logic, ch. 4 (4th Ed, pp. azo-222).

There are many departments ol knowledge and practice in which it is
almost impossible to exaggerate the importante ol insisting on a precise
repetition of all tbe circumstances (or, at least, all the material circum-
stances) nithe case, before inserring that the same result will recur.
This fact is strikingly illustrated by the widely different effects of medi·
cines in different climates. See, lor instances, the Introduction to Dr.
Paris' Pharmacologia, pp. rao-123.

⁷⁶ The laults in experimentation as then practised, which are noted by
Bacon in this Aphorism, may be enumerated as five:

(1) Undue extension of inlerences based on experience to other in-
stances apparently similar, without sufficient cantion in allowing lor pos·
sible differences of circurnstances;

(2) Haphazard experiment, without pursuing any definite order or
making any selection of instances ;

(3) Insufficient variation ol experiments;

(4) Pursuit ol one experiment‚ or subject, to the neglect of all others ;

( 5) Excessive eagerness to arrive at the practical application.

The account os the last three of these laults is borrowed srom Dr.
Kitchin’s note. He gives a lourfold division, but, though there is some
obscurity in the early part ol the Aphorism, l am inclined to think that
the passage from ‘Sed demonstratio’ down to ‘deserendo’ is intended to
specily three distinct laults.

⁷⁶ Bacon is berc probably alluding to the fashion of trying experiments
without any order or method‚ ‘mera palpatio' as he calls it in Aph. roo
and the De Augrnentis. Cp. lib. v. cap. 2: ‘Ars ista Indicii (ita enim
earn appellabimus) duas habet partes. Aut enim defertur Indicium ab
experimentis ad experimenta,· aut ab experimentis ad axiomata, quae et
ipsa nova experimenta designent. Priorem harum Experientiam Literatam
nominabimus, posteriorem vero Interpretationem Naturae, sive Novum
Organum. Prior quidem (ut alibi attigimus) vix pro Arte habenda est
aut parte Philosophiae, sed pro sagacitate quadam: unde etiarn eam
