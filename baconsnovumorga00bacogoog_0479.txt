Ex iis, quae ante dicta sunt, patet quod quinque illa in-
stantiarum genera de quibus diximus (viz. instantiarum can-
formium, instantiarum monadicarnm instantiarum dem‘an·
tium, instantiarum limitaneam, instantiarum potcstatis) non
debeant reservari, donec inquiratur natura aliqua certa (quem-
admodum instantiae reliquae, quas primo loco proposuimus,

· nec non plurimae ex iis quae sequentur, reservari debent):

sed statim jam ab initio facienda est earum collectio, tanquam
historia quaedam particularis3 eo quod digerant eaquae in·
grediuntur intellectum, et corrigant pravam complexionem
intellectus ipsius, quem omnino necesse est imbui et infici
et demum perverti ac distorqueri ab incursibus quotidianis
et consuetis ²⁹.

the same part oi his own. And thus the distant friend, by a new kind of
Chiromancy, may read in his own hand what his correspondent had set
down in his. For instance, would l in London acquaint my intimate
in Paris, that Iam well : 1 would then prick that part where l had
appointed the letter [1] and, doing so in another place to signitie that
word was done, proceed to [A] thence to [M] and so on, till 1 had finisht
what l intended to make known!

‘Theo there is a Magnetick way oi curing wounds by anointing the
weapon, and that the wouud is affected in like manner as is the exna-
venate blood hythe Syropathetick medicine, as to matter oi fact is with
circumstances oi good evidence asserted hythe N oble Sir K. Digby in his
ingenious discourse on the subject. The reason oi this magnale he
attempts by Mechanism, and endeavours to make it out by atomical
aporrheas, which passing from the cruentate eloth or weapon to the
wound, and being incorporated with the particles of the salve carry
them in their embraces to the affected part: where the medicinal atomes,
euteriog together with the effluviums of the blood, do by their subtle
insinuation better effect the cure, than can be done by any grosser ap·
plication. The particular way oi their conveyance and their regular
direction is handsomely explicated by that learned Knight, and recom-
mended to the ingenious by most witty and becoming illustratione. It
is out oi my way here to enquire whether the Anima Mundi be not
a better account than any Mechanical Solutions. The formeris more
desperate; the latter perhaps hath more of ingenuity than good ground
oi satisfaction. It is enough ior me that de facta there is such an en-
tercourse between the Magnetick unguent and the vulnerated body, and
1 need nothe solicitous ol the cause’
