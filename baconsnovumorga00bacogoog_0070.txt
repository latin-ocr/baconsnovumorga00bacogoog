ln Nov. Org. ii. 46, we have the brilliant conjecture that the actual
state of the starry sky precedes by an interval oi time that which is
apparent to us, in other words, that light requires time ior its trans-
mission. ‘Atque hoc, cum similibus, nobis quandoque dubitationem
peperit plane monstrosam ; videlicet, utrum coeli sereni et stellati
iacies ad idem tempus cernatur quando vere existit, an potius
aliquanto post3 et utrum non sit (quatenus ad visum coelestium)
non minus tempus verum, et tempus visum, quarn locus verus et
locus visus, qui notatur ab astronomis in parallaxibus. Adeo incredi-
bile nobis videbatur, species sive radios corporum coelestium per tam
immensa spatia milliarium subito deferri posse ad visum; sed potius
debere eas in tempore aliquo notabili delabi? Uniortunately, Bacon
proceeds to explain away his conjecture by arguments almost as
perverse as the thought itsell is felicitous ¹³.

Amongst Bacon's claims to the recognition oi scientific men, a
high place ought to be given to his felicitous illustration oi the
‘Instantiae Solitariae¹⁴' by the enquiry into the causes oi Colour.
The passage, to which, with my notes upon it, l must refer the reader,
might justly be regarded as a striking anticipation of the optical
investigatione, afterwards so deservedly celebrated, oi Newton.

In connexion with the same subject, Imay refer to some inter-
esting speculations on the phenomena oi Relraction in Sylva Sylva-
rum, Exps. 761, 762.

Both M. Bouillet and Mr. Ellis rightly call attention to the import-
anee ol an experiment, tried with a hollow globe ol lead, by which
Bacon attempted to determine the question oi the compressibility or
incompressibility ol water ¹³. This experiment has every appearance
oi having been original, and certainly preceded by nearly fifty years
the celebrated experiment ol a similar nature, usually called the
Florentine experiment, made by the Accadcmia del Cimento at
Florence. Both experiments were, as we now know, inconclusive,

ol Bccon's change ol opinionon this subject. On the causes ol the semi-diumal
ebb and flow he seems to have been inclined to adopt an entirely different opinion.

¹⁴ Nov. Org. ii. aa.

¹⁵ See Nor. Org. ti. 45, 50 (a); Historia Densi et Rari (E. and S, vol. ii.
pp. ²99· 300). From these passages it appears that liacoo thought he had demon-
strated the compressibility oi water. From the F lorentine experiment, so lar as
any conclusion at all was dmwn, it vas the opposite one. On the subject generally,
see my notes on Nov. Org. ii. 45.
