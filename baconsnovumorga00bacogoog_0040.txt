RELATION TO BACON’S OTHER WORKS. 11

bad been better not to have published this Natural History.’ In my
remarks on Liebig‚ under the section headed ‘Opponents of Bacon,'
I have spoken at greater length on this subiect.

Appended to the Sylva Sylvarum in Ravley's Edition is the
New Atlantis, a work also then for the first time published. This is
deservedly one of the most popular of Bacon's works; it bears the
stamp of bis genius as much, perhaps, as anything which he wrote;
and, lastly, it is credited, and I conceive justly s0, with having, to
a large extent, suggested the foundation and programme of our
own Royal Society, if not of several foreign scientific associations as
well. Its relation to the Sylva Sylvarum cannot be better described
than in the language of Mt. Spedding :-‘ The New Atlantis seems to
have been written in 1624, and, though not finished, to have been
intended for publication as it stands. It was published accordingly
by Dr. Rawley in 1627, at the end of the volume containing the
Sylva Sylvarum ; for which place Bacon had himself designed it, the
subjects of the two being so near akin3 the one representing his idea
of what should be the end of the work which in the other he sup·
posed himself to be beginning. F or the story of Solomon’s House is
nothing more than a vision of the practical results which he antici-
pated from the study of natural history diligently and systematically
carried on through successive generations ¹⁴.'

Amongst the ‘Impetus Philosophici' which occupy the latter part
of Gruter's volume are two small pieces entitled Scala Intellectus
sive Filum labyrinthi and Prodromi sive Anticipationes Philoso
phiae Secundae. These were intended as Prefaces to the fourth and
fifth parts of the Instauratio respectively. Whether anything more
relating to these parts is extant seems open to doubt. Possibly the

· Inquisitio legitima de Motu sive Filum labyrinthi may be an

‘exemplar' belonging to the fourth part, but Mr. Spedding inclines to
think that it was designed originally as the example of method for the
second part of the Instauration‚ and subsequently abandoned for the

Inquisitio de Forma Calidi. As respects the fifth part, however,
Mr. Spedding seems disposed to admit to aplace among the Pro
dromi the treatises entitled De Fluxu et Refluxu Maris, De Prin·
cipiis atque Originibus, Cogitationes de Natura Rerum, and Thema
Coeli, of which last 1 have already spoken in connexion with the
Descriptio Globi Intellectualis.
