10 κ INTRODUCTION.

Bacon published a small volume entitled Historia Naturalis, dcc,
quae est Instaurationis Magnae Pars Tertia In'the beginning of
the Dedication, he thus describes his design and the characteres the
present instalment: ‘Primitias Historiae nostrae Naturalis Celsitudini
tuae humillime offero. Rem mole perpusillam, veluti Granum Sinapis:
sed tamen pignus eorum, quae Deo volente sequentur. Obstrinximus
enim nos ipsos tanquam voto, singulis nos mensibus, ad quos Dei
bonitas (cujus agitur Gloria tanquam in cantico novo) vitam nostram
produxerit, unam aut plures ejus partes, prout. fuerint magis aut
minus arduae aut copiosae, confecturos et edituros. Moti etiam
fortasse erunt alii, nostro exemplo, ad similem industriam : praesertim
postquam penitus perspexerint, quid agatur. Nam in Historia Natu·
rali bona, et bene instituta, claves sunt et Scientiarum et Operum!
This volume contains only general preiatory remarks, the Historia
Ventorum, andan Aditus to each of the following proposed treatises:
Historia Densi et Rari; Historia Gravis et Levis ; Historia Sym·
pathiae et Antipathiae Rerum3 Historia sulphuris, Mercurii, et Salis 3
and Historia Vitae et Mortis. These five ‘Historiae' were to iollow
the Historia Ventorum at intervals oi a month. It appears that the
volume containing the Historia Ventorum was published about the
beginning of November, 16223 the Historia Vitae et Mortis about
the end oi the following January, roua-3¹². The reason sor bringing
out the latter book before the four intermediate ones is stated to be
‘propter eximiam rei utilitatem3 in qua vel minima temporis jactura
pro pretiosa haberi debet! The Historia Densi et Rari did not
appear till the publication oi Dr. Rawley’s Opuscula Varia Posthuma
in 1658. It goes over a good deal of the same g'roum as a tract,
entitled Phaenomena Universa, published by Gruter in 1653¹³. The
remaining th1ee subjects Bacon does not appear to have handled, at
least in separate treatises. ’

The Sylva Sylvarum, which is a miscellaneous collection of obser·
vations and experiments, taken mainly from books, was not published
till after Bacon’s death. It was edited by Rawley in 1627, Bacon
having died in 1626. Interesting in many respects as this collection

is, it is the least creditable of Bacon’s philosophical works‚ and has
fumished Liebig and other antagonists with many of their most
effective weapons. In fact, as Bacon is reported by Rawley to have
said himself, ‘if he should have served the glory oi his own Name, he
