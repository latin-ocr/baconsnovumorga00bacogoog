xvi PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

granted in the courts and camps of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries; and a writer so analytic, and,
Ι may add, so candid as Bacon was certain to bring·
out this dark side of political morality in bold relief,
though with him its recognition is most distinctly the ex-
ception and not the rule, while, with Machiavelli, it is
the postulate and basis of his entire system. Another
observation, which should never be lost sight of in
reading any of Bacon's writings, is the tendency, which
he shared with many authors of his generatim, to lay
peculiar emphasis on the particular aspect of a subject
with which he happened, at the time, to be dealing.
All qualifications and countervailing considerations are,
for the moment kept out of sight, and the object is to
place before the reader a particular point of view in its
strongest colours What Bacon himself would have
called a ‘ glaring instance’ of this mode of treatment
is to be found in the Temporis Partus Masculus (see
introductiom pp. 8, 9), where he sets himself to ‘dis-
course scornfully of the philosophy of the Grecians.’
Another good instance is to be found in the ‘ Antitheta’
in the sixth Book of the De Augmentis (see especially
E. and S., vol. Ι, p. 688, etc). But instances of this
kind abound in Bacon's works, and we need not go
further than the Novum Organum to find our examples‚
such as are notably the attacks on Aristotle or Gilbert
and the apparent depreciation of syllogistic logie.
Hence, there is, perhaps, no author with regard to
whom it is so necessary to lay together the various
utterances on a subject, as scattered throughout his
works, before arriving at a definite estimate of his real

opinions
