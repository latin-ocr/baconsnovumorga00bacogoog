The best German translation, I believe, is Franz Baco’s Neues
Organon, Uebersetzt, erldutert, &c., von J. H. von Kirchmann.
Berlin, 1870 (published in Kirchmann’s Philosophische Bibliothek).
Previous German translations are those of Bartholdy (ist Book only),
17933 and of Briick, 1830. ’

Ι have seen an Italian translation (anonymous) published at
Bassano in 1788: Nuovo Organo delle Scienze di Francesco
Bacone, &a Traduzione in ltaliano, con Annotazioni, &c Whether
there is any more recent translation, I am not aware.

In the leipsic edition of the Novum Organum, 1839, a Portuguese
translation of the Obras philosophicas, by Jac. de Castro Sarmento,
is mentioned as having been published in London, with notes, in
3 vols. 4to., in 1731.

A collection of Bacon’s works (Bakon. Sobranie Sochinenii), trans-
lated by P. A. Bibiker, was published in Russian‚ at St. Petersburg,

in 1874.

the Novum organum contemporary, 1 believe, or almost contemporary with the
original publication of the work. It is written iu a beautiful hand, very similar to
much of the writiug which 1 have seen in MSS. of Bacon's own time, and not likely,
M. Deprez, one of the gentlemeu attached to the Maunscript Departmeut, iufonned
me, to be later than the early part of the seventeenth oeutnry. This MS, which
is numbered Fr. 19,092, formerly belonged to the Coislin Collection and subse·
qneutly to the Library of St. Germain des Pres. The description of it in the
Catalogue is as follows: ‘Ex Bibliotheca MSS. Coisliniana, olim Segueriana, quam
illustr. Heuricus Du Cambout, Dux de Coislin, Par Franciae, Episcopus Metensis,
&c., Monasterio S. Germani a Pratis legavit. An. Μ Dec. xxxii! In the Catalogue
of Seguier's Collectiou of MSS. (Paris, 1686), this MS. is not mentioned.

sse piece is eutitled Me'thodes et conceptions dn sieur vernum, chana
d‘Angleterre, aud begins ‘Tableau des belles et rares conceptions de Messire
franeois Verulam chanv de la grand Bretagne touchauts le restablissemen des
seienoes et l’exp‘t' dela methode.’ It then proceeds much as in the opening words
of the Great Instauratiou. The order of the pieces in the tst Erlition is followed
throughout, including the Deest Pars Prima, &c., which, so faras Ι am aware,
occurs iu uo other edition of the seventeenth or eighteenth century. The trans·
lation of the ist Book leaves off at the beginning of the torst Aphorism, a space
being lest for the insertion of that and the remaining Aphorisms of the tst Book.
The and Book is translated as far as the words ‘de forma calidi' in nph. 11, just
before the commencemeut of the Tables. There are no blank leaves after this break.

This translation is not, so far as 1 cau ascertain, mentioned by any writer on
Bacou, and the translations of Lasalle aud Lorquet bear no signs of its having been
consulted by those authors. ‚⁴

1 am inclined to suspect that this translation mayhave been made by J. Baudoin,
who published translations of so many other works of Bacon, and who, as appears
from the ‘ Privilege dn Roy,' prefixed to his Aphorismes du Droit, had by hima
stock of translations from Baton, which he contemplated publishing from time to
time.
