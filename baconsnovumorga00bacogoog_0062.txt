immediate acceptance of that system to ignorance‚ prejudice, and
over adherence to antiquity. No doubt all these things can be traced;
but the ignorance was of a kind which belonged equally to the
partisans and to the opponents, and which fairly imposed on the pro
pounder of the system the onus of meeting arguments, which, in the
period we speak of, he did not and could not meet. It must be
remembered that, in the sixteenth century, the wit of man could not
imagine how, if the earth moved, a stone thrown directly upwards
would tumble down upon the spot it was thrown from. Easy ex·
periments verify the law of motion which now explains this; but, to
be proved by experiment, a law must be conceived and imagined.
'To be put under discussion, it must be proposed. Now the advocates
of the earth’s motion never, before the time of Galileo, even con-
ceived this law, never proposed it, and of course never proved it.’
Itis possible to draw up a long list of eminent men, astronomers
and others, anterior to or contemporary with Bacon, who adopted
and taught the Copemican theory. Such were Rheticus, Reinhold,
author of the Prutenic tables (who, however, according to Delambre⁸²,
simply made use of the observations of Copemicus for the purpose of
constructing tables, and gave no opinion as to the motion of either
the earth or the sun), Peter Ramus, Francis Patrizi (Patricius),
Giordano Bruno, Thomas Digges, Williarn Gilbert, Maestlin (who,
however, seems to have been mainly a mathematical Copemican), and,
lastly, Kepler and Galileo themselves. But of these, some, like
Patricius, Bruno, and Ramus, do not seem to have had any very
good reasons for their opinions. Others, like Gilbert⁰³, to whom we
may add Patricius, only admitted the diurnal motion of the earth,
and may therefore be claimed by either side. And against this list
we may put the great name of Tycho Brahe⁰⁴ (who, however,
having died in 1601, did not live to become acquainted with the dis·
coveries of Galileo), Vieta, the greatest French mathematician of the

¹¹ Delambre, Histoire de l'Astronomie Moderne, tome i. pp. 145, 146: ‘Il n'a
rien change aux theories, il n'a songe qu'a perfectionner les nombres? Still
Delarnbre thinks that he bad a preference for Copemlcanisru.

'⁸ See Descriptio Globi Intellectualis (E. and 8., vol. iii. p. 742). In accordance
with this opinion, as cited by Bacon aod possibly orally commuulcated to blm by
Gilbert, are the silenoe on the orbitalmotion observed in the De Magnete, lib. vi.
capp. 3, 4, and the enumeration of the difficulties attending the theory ln the
posthumous worlr, De Mundo Nostro sublunari, lib. ii. cap. ao.

‘⁴ As is well known, Tycho Brahe propounded a system of his own, according
to which the planeta, with the exception of the moon, move round the suu, while
theson itself, with lts attendant planets, moves round the earth.
