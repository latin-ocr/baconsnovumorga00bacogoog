atque ejus schola ³⁸. Invenitur etiam hoc genus mali in
partibus philosophiarum reliquarum, introducendo formas
abstractas ³⁹, et causas finales, et causas primas ⁴⁰3 omittendo
saepissime medias, et hujusmodi. Huic autem rei summa
adhibenda est cautio. Pessima enim res est errorum apo·
theosis ⁴¹, et pro peste intellectus habenda est, si vanis accedat
veneratio. Huic autem vanitati nonnulli ex modernis ⁴²

inficere: et si verum dicendum est, tarn prope ad poetae, quarn illurn
ad sophistae panes accedere!

ln the Temporis Partus Masculus, the attack on Plato is lar more
vehement: ‘Citetur jam et Plato, cavillator urbanus, tumidus poeta,
theologus mente captus,' dcc. See Ε. and S., vol. iii. pp. 530-1.

³⁸ The reference may be either to the immediate followers os Plato, that
isto the Old Academy‚ or to the Neoplatonists, called in Aph. 96 ‘ secunda
schola Platonis! To the latter, whose philosophy was mainly mystical, it
would be peculiarly applicable. To the N ew Academy, which was properly
‘secunda schola Platonis,’ it would be inapplicable, as the tendencies of
that school were ol quite a different character. ,

³⁹ F orms abstracted irom matter, as opposed to determined in matter.
Some ol the more extreme realists maintained that forms or essences
had an existence independent ol and anterior to the individual objecta
in which they are manifested. This was the doctrine oi ‘universalia
ante rem.’

⁴⁰ Bacon always insists on referring physical events to physical causes,
and not, as was sermore frequently the case in his time than our own, to
the immediate action ol God. Cp. Advancement of Learning‚ bk. i. (E.
and S., vol. iii. p. 267): ‘For certain it is that God worketh nothing in
nature but by second causes; and il they would have it otherwise believed,
it is mere impostura, as it were in favour towards God; and nothing else
but to offer to the author ol truth the unclean sacrifice ol a lie! ln the
corresponding passage ol the De Augrnentis, bk. i. (E. and S., vol i. p.
436), he speaks rather more cautiously: ‘Liquet enirn Deum nihil operari
ordinario in natura nisi per secundas causas,' tte.

⁴¹ Cp. the Temporis Partus Masculus (E. and S., vol. iii. p. 5 31), where,
in addressing Plato, he says: ‘Deinde etiam tu scelere haud minore
sttdtitiae apotheosin introduxisti, et vilissimas cogitationes religione munire
ausus es!

⁴⁴ Bacon is probably alluding more especially to his contemporary
Dr. Rohert Fludd (b. 1574, d. 1637), whose writings present a strange
jumble oi physics, theology, and mysticism. lle was the author of
many works on science and medicine, but the one to which Bacon pro·
bably here alludes is that entitled: ‘Utriusque Cosmi metaphysica,
physica atque technica historia,’ published in 1617. A second volume
ot this work appeared in1619,with the quaint title: ‘Tomus Secundus
De supernaturali, Naturali, Praetematurali, et Contranaturali Microcosmi
historia! Any one acquainted with the history oi Geology will recall
