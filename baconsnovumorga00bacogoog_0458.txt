ΗΒ. ΙΙ. 26. 429

suevimus. Eae sunt quae constituunt unam speciem naturae
inquisitae tanquam Formam Minorem. Cum enim formae
legitimae (quae sunt semper convertibiles cum naturis inqui·
sitis) lateant iu profundo nec facile inveniantur, postulat res
et infirmitas humani intellectus ut formae particulares ⁷⁰, quae
suut congregativae Manipulorum quorundam instantiarum
(neutiquam vero omnium) in notionem aliquam communem,
non negligantur, verum diligentius notentur. Quicquid enim
unit naturam, licet modis imperfectis, ad inventionem ior·
marum viam sternit. Itaque instantiae, quae ad hoc utiles
sunt, non sunt contemnendae potestatis, sed habeut nonnullam
Praerogativam.

Verum in his diligens est adhibenda cautio, ne intellectus
humanus, postquam complures ert istis formis particularibus
adinvenerit atque inde partitiones sive divisiones naturae
inquisitae confecerit, in illis omnino acquiescat, atque ad in-

the discovery ol the great principle os Gravitation. ‘These discoveries
were all made before Bacon wrote, but heis silent conceming them ; for
the want ol mathematical knowledge coucealed from bis view some oi the
most splendid and interesting parts ol science.’

⁴ Astronomy is lull oi such collective instances, and affords them, indeed,
oi the second and third order, that is to say, two or three times gene·
ralised. The astronomer observes nothing but that a certain luminous
disk, or perhaps merely a luminous point, is in a certain position, in respect
os the planes ol the meridiau and the horizon, at a certain moment oi
time. By comparinga number ol such observations, he finds that this
luminous point moves in a certain plane, with a certain velocity, and per-
iorms a revolution in a certain time Thus, the periodic time oi a planet
is itself a collective lact, or a single lact expressing the result oi many
hundred observations. This holds with respect to each planet, and with
respect to each clement, as it is called, os the planet's orbit‚ every one ol
which is a general iact, expressing the result os an indefinite number oi
particulars. Tbis holds still more remarkably oi the inserentes which
extend to the distances ol the planet from the earth, or from the sun.
The lawe of Kepler are therefore collective t'acts ol the second, or even
a higher order ; or such as comprehend a great number oi general iacts,
each oi which is itseli a general fact, including many particulare: Pre-
liminary Dissertation.

⁷⁰ These formae minores or particulares correspond with the axiomata
infima or some os the lower degrees of the axiomata media ol Bk. i. (see,
lor instance, i. 104). They might be described as the delinitione oi specific
(though still general) exemplifications oi the nature under examination.
