BACON’S RELIGIOUS'OPJNJONS. 51

be guides to an outward'moral virtue, though religion were not3 but

superstition dismounts all these, and erecteth an absolute monarchy '
in the minds ol men. Therefore atheism did never perturb states3 ''

for it makes men wary of themselves, as looking no further: and '

we see the times inclined to atheism (as the time of Augustus Caesar)
were civil times But superstition hath been the confusion of many
states, and bringeth iu a new prr'mum mobile, that ravisheth all the

spheres of govemment ¹⁸! In this passage, I think, Bacon thoroughly ι
represents the spirit oi his time. The recoil from the superstitious “

of the Church of Rome, and especially from the dangers with which
the machinations of that Church seemed to threaten the civil power, ·
had become, in the reformed countries, so intense, and almost so
unreasoning, that men could conceive of no opinions equally dan-
gerous either to the well-being of the individual conscience or to the
security of the state. It required experiences like those ol the Freneh
Revolution to convince men that the dissolution os the restraints of
religion, in minds which irom infancy had been accustomed to them,
might be even still more desolating in its effects on morals and
govemment. And meanwhile, this view, as stated by Bacon, bore
fruit and multiplied. The undiscriminating denunciation of Super·
stition in the seventeenth century, coupled with the sreer mode ol
enquiry into the fundamentals of religion which marked the close
os the period, terminated in results, which, however much he may
have contributed to them, he would probably have been among the
last to welcome.

8th. The last point which 1 shall notice is also one which had
a great and undoubted effect on subsequent speculation. The
interests of Bacon, as we have seen, were in the progressos science.
What he, above all things, desired was a clear and unimpeded course
for his favourite pursuit. Now he could never lorget (or the divines
and controversialists of his time would never have allowed him to
sorget) what he states so emphatically in the Novum Organum²⁹,
‘quod nacta sit Philosophia Naturalis per omnes aetates adversarium
molestum et difficilem ; superstitionem nimirum, et zelum religionis
caecum et immoderatum! What then so effectual, and what so obvious,
as to declare an entire separation between the spheres of Science and
Theology, of Reason and Faith? Their admixture had made the
