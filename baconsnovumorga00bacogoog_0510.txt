in the daytime with that of a cloud was ingeniously applied by Bouguer to
determine the ratio ol the moon’s light to the sun's.

¹² ‘Bacon’s reason ior this phenomenon is wrong. lt is really the
polished suriace ol the glass which reflecte the rays: and this is always

the case, but is only visible to us when there is neither light nor object '

on the other side to destroy the image created! Dr. Kitchin's note.

¹³ All that these Instances prove is that other than solid bodies reflect
light, and hence it follows that, because the moon reflects light, we cannot
inser that it is a solid body. But, though they dispose ol the argument,
they do not dispose ol the conclusion. How little Bacon anticipated that
the time would come, when we should be ableto weigh the moon, to
know something of its chemical constituents, and to map out its surface
with perfect accuracy!

The question whether other than solid bodies refleet light is a good
example of an unr'lateral test (see the end of the first note on this Aphar-
ism). lf decided one way, it proves that the moon is a solid body; it
decided the other way, it proves nothing.

¹⁴ Cp. Aph. 23. There, he says, ‘corpora omnino aequalia (secundum
portiones optieas) darediaphanum.’ The optical generalisation that every
ray of light incident on a sursace is either reflected, or transmitted, or
absorbed, or disposed oi in all or some ol these ways, was, ol course,
unlmown to Bacon.
