interciperentur saepenumero, et confunderentur ³⁸. Atque de
mensuris tempomm simplicibus haec dicta sint.

Verum non solum quaerenda est mensura motuum et actio-
num simpliciter, sed multo magis comparative: id enim eximii
est usus, et ad plurima spectat. Atque videmus flammam ali-
cujus tormenti ignei citius cerni, quam sonitus audiatur; licet
necesse sit pilam prius aerem percutere, quam flamma quae
pone erat exire potuerit; fieri hoc autem propter velociorem
transactionem motus lucis,quam soni. Videmus etiam species ἵ
visibiles a visu citius excipi quam dimitti 39; unde fit quod ²
nervi fidium, digito impulsi, duplicentur aut triplicentur quoad
speciem, quia species nova recipitur, antequam prior demit-
tatur⁴03 ex quo etiam fit, ut annuli rotati videantur globosi
et fax ardens, noctu velociter portata, conspiciatur caudata
Etiam ex hoc fundamento inaequalitatis motuurn quoad
velocitatem, excogitavit Galilaeus⁴¹ causam fluxus et refluxus

⁸⁸ 1 think that Bacon must here have in mind cosmical clouds, in the
interstellar spaces, not ordinary or aerial clouds. The argument is thar
the light of the stars, if it took a long time for its transmission‚ would be
frequently stupped by various obstacles in the sky, whereas, on a clear
night, we invariably see the stars where we expect to find them. At the
same time, it must be confessed that, if there were such obstacles as 1 am l
supposing Bacon to contemplate, the light might sometimes be intercepted,
however instantaneous its transmission. There is, then, an undoubred
difficulty in the passage, though it does not appear to me so great as it
seems to appear to Mr. Spedding.

³⁹ The retention of images on the retina of the eye is a familiar pheno
menon, of which the reader will easily supply himself with instances. The
duration of the persistence varies with the intensity of the light and the
sensitiveness of the organ. ‘M. Platean has investigated the duration of
the impression by numerous methods, and has found that it is on the
average half a second* a s A great number of pieces of apparatus are
founded on the persistence of sensation on the retina. Such are the ’
thaumatrope, the phenalristoscope, Faraday's wheel, the kaleidophone,
and the zoetrope.' Ganots Physics, 12th Ed, ξ 625.

⁴⁰ Mr. Ellis says that ‘in the case of vibrating strings Eacon's explana-
tion is not altogether complete. The distinct or quasi-distinct images to
which he refers correspond to limiting positions of the vibrating string!

⁴¹ ‘This account of Galileo's theory of the tides is inaccurate ln this
theory the tides are caused by the varying velocity of different points of
the earth's surface, nrising from the composition of the earth’s two
motions, namely that about its axis, and that in its orbit Bacon does not ῑ
seem to have perceived that both these motions are essential to the l
