Baconical Philosophers,' ‘this Bacon-iaced generation‚’ dre. (showing,
by the way, pretty conclusively, the influence which was already
supposed to be exercised by Bacon’s philosophy), and, as a professed
admirer oi the old learning, somewhat inconsistently ‘declares that
the Lord Bacon did steal the principal parts os his Novum Organum
out of Aristotle, and only disguised his suggestions in anew Mode
und Dress.’ similarly, the Advancement of Leaming was stolen
from Ludovicus Vives, De causis cornrptarum Artium ⁰². ‘The
only judgment 1 can make of my Lord Bacon's Actings is that
being so Flagitious, and so ignominiously degraded: He detennined
to redeem the Inlamy oi his past lise by amusing the world with
New Projects; and to gain a Chancellorship in Literature, when he
was excluded from that on the Bench: And to revenge himself of the
Nation whom he had exasperated, by diffusing Heresies in Philosophy,
and creating in the Bressts oi the English such a desire of Novelty
as rose up to a contempt oi the Aneient Ecclesiastical and Civil
Jurisdiction, and the Old Govemment as well as Govemours of the
Realm: And the Root oi all our present Distractions was planted by
his hand? See ‘The Lord Bacon’s Relation os the Sweating-Sr'clrness
and Desence oi Phlebotomy3' ‘Discourse conceming Phlebotomy,'
Presace to the Reader. Abundance of evidence shewing Bacon's
influence on the ‘Baconiaced generation' is supplied in this diatribe.
Thus, ‘We acknowledge no Chancellors of Philosophy, Philology,
Medicine, ἃς] ‘No Law ever made him our Dictator, nor is there
any Reason that concludes him infallible! ‘Let these insulse Ad-
herents os his buy some salt, and make use oi more than one grain,
when they read him! Elsewhere, Stubbe informs his readers that
it is only out of his regard to Physic, Religion, and Education, that he
is led to intermeddle in ‘Natural Philosophy,' or the disputes of these
‘Experimental Philosophers.'

Passing to the middle oi the eighteenth century, when Bacon was
at the zenith of his glory, we find the chorus of approbation broken
by the modified praise rather than the disparagement of Hume. The
weapon which Hume wielded‚ comparison with philosophers who
have made positive contributions to science, is one which has since

‘¹ Having occasion to compare a remedy against the Sweating·slekness given by
Holinshed the Chrouieler with oue given by Bucen, he says: ‘The works ol the
former will be much more valued than the letter by our astion, as long ss they
hare rury jndgment. The tmth is the Lord Baeon is like great piles; when the
Suu is not high, they esst an extraordinary shudow orer the earth, which lesseneth
ss the Suu grows verticall.’ Legeuds no Histories, pp. η, 28.
