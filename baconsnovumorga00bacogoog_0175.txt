story be accurate, the original composition of the Novum Organum
would be carried back to the year 1608. But the substance of the
First Book is to be found in awork composed at a still earlier period,
the Cogitata et Visa (E. and S., vol. iii. pp. 587-620). This work,
though not published till long after Bacon’s death (by Gruter in
16 5 3), must have been composed as early as the summer or autumn
of 1607, as, in that and the early part of the following year, it is the
subject of a correspondence between Bacon and Sir Thomas Bodley
(Spedding's Life and Letters of Bacon‚ vol. iii. pp. 365, 366) ⁷⁶. Still
earlier, but standing in much less close relation with the First Book
of the Novum organum, as it now'exists, is the Partis Secundae
Delineatio (E. and S, vol. iii. pp. 541-585), which Mr. Spedding
refers to the year 1606 or 1607. For an account of this, however,
and other preliminary drafts of portions of the Novum Organum, the
student must be referred back to § 3 of this Introduction.

The soealled Second Edition of the Novum Organum is a small
duodecimo, published at Amsterdam in 1660, but, between this and
the First Edition, there were copies published at Leyden 13 3645 and
1650 11. Except in editions of the Complete Works 333133 philoso-
phical works of Bucon, I cannot find any latin Edition of the Novum
Organum between the year 1660 and the Wilrzburg Edition of 1780 ⁷⁷.
One appeared at Glasgow in18o3,and another was issued by the
Clarendon Press in 1813. Since that time, Dr. Kitchin’s and other
annotated Editions, to be mentioned below, bave made the work, in
its separate form, easily procurable.

'⁵ A very beautiful manuscript of this work, corrected in Bacon’s own hand-
writing (a fact which is not only vouched for by Mr. Spedding, but which 1 bave
verified by comparisou with a letter iu the Bodleian written by 113333 to the King,
April 33, 3633), exists in Queeu's Collega Library, Oxford.

'⁶ Euuillet speaks of 33 Edition, published at Leyden in165a. lean find no ’
331333 trace of this Edition, and think that he must have mistaken for an edition
of the Novum Organum one of the De Augrnentis published at Leyden in that year.
His bibliograpbical account, generally, is not very accurate. Thus, the Ed. of 1⁶50
(which, like that of 1645, was published by Adr. Wiugaerdel is called 33 Elzevir.

ln 1638, a little ramo volume was issued at Leyden, entitled Fraucisci de Veru-
lamio Historia Naturalis et Experimentalis De Ventis, &c.‚ containing, in addition
to the Historia Ventorum and other matter, Nov. Org. ii. rt-ao (‘ De Forma
Calidi '), ii. 48 (‘De Motus slve Virtutis Activae Variis Speciebus'l, and the In·
stantia Crucis on the Tides from ii. 36. In the British Museum, there are reprints
of this volume iu 1648 aud 3663. It was translated by R G. Geut, London, 1⁶53·

'⁷ wau (Bibliotheca Britannica) speaks of an edition infolio, published at
Loudon in 1677, but, as 1 ean find 3ο 331333 traee of this edition, 1 suppose be must
referto the Epitome by M. D. iu English, to be noticed presently.
