passage of his, Incredibile est quantum agmen Idolorum Philosophiae
immiserit, Naturalium operationum ad Similitudinem Actionum
Humanarum Reductio. But if that of his be extended further, to
take away all Final Causes from the things of Nature, as if nothing

were done therein for Ends Intended bya Higher Mind, then it is
the very Spirit of Atheism and Infidelity.’ For the whole discussion,

see First Edition, pp. 679-683, or the latin Translation of 1733,
vol. ii. pp. 820-825 (cap. 5. §5 61, 62). Mosheim, who points out that
the allusion is to Baeon, attempta, in his note, to explain ‘quare Cud-
worthius toties eximium huncce virum castiget, qui magnam ubique
in scriptis suis supremi Numinis reverentiam et studium testatur⁸⁰.’
Tbere can be little doubt that, in his frequent attacks on the philosophy
of Democritus, Cudworth also glances at Baeon, De Remusat draws
attention to the circumstance that Cudworth did not combat Bacon
by name ‘Par equite ou par respect, il n’en veut pas faire un
adversaire de la verite. Ainsi que Boyle dans sa defense des causes
finales, Cudworth ne nomme point Bacon en soutenant les memes

principes que Boyle, et l'usage s’est etabli presque sans exception de
ne pas comprendre Bacon dans les attaques dirigees contre sa
doctrine. Compromettre ce nom dans la controverse serait encore

aujourd’hui une sorte d’inconvenance.’ De Remusat's Baeon,
P· 409·

One of the most violent antagonists of Bacon and of the Royal
Society (names which, in his mind, were evidently very closely con-
nected) was Dr. Henry Stubbe; ‘the most noted person of his age
that these late times have produced' says Antony Wood, who has
devoted to him one os the quaintest and most amusing of his Lives⁶¹.
Stubbe vas a turncoat alike in philosophy, religion, and politica and
was animated by more even than the usual bitterness of his class.
His diatribes against Sprat, Glanvill, the Royal Society in general,
and Bacon as their philosophical father, are, however virulent, too
dull and rambling to be worth transcription, but specimens of them
may be found in the Legends no Histories (1670), in the Plus
Ultra reduced to a Non Plus (1670), The Lord Bacon's Relation
of the Sweating-Sickness (1671), and An Epistolary Discourse
concerning Phlebotomy (1671). He speaks repeatedly of ‘these

ton, vol. it. pp. 337·339) has some severe remarks on Cudworth, who, he thinlrs, is
uocandid in his treatment of Bacon. He also points out his carelessness iu con·
