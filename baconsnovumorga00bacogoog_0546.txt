Perlationis, velde Non Ultra appellare consuevimus. Virtutes
enim rerum et motus operantur et expediuntur per spatia non
indefinita aut lortuita, sed finita et certa; quae ut in singulis
naturis inquisitis teneantur et notentur plurimum interest
practicae, non solum ad hoc, ut non sallat, sed etiam ut magis
sitauctaet potens. Etenim interdum datur virtutes producere,
et distantias tanquam retrahere in propius; ut in perspecillis.

Atque plurimae virtutes operantur et afficiunt tantum per
tactum manifestum3 ut fit in percussione corporum, ubi
alterum non summovet alterum, nisi impellens impulsum
tangat. Etiam medicinae quae exterius applicantur, ut
unguenta, emplastra, non exercent vires suas nisi per tactum
corporis. Denique objecta sensuum tactus et gustus non
feriunt nisi contigua organis.

Sunt et aliae virtutes quae operantur ad distantiam, verum
valde exiguam, quarum paucae adhuc notatae sunt, cum tamen
plures sint quam homines suspicentur: ut (capiendo exempla
ex vulgatis) cum succinum aut gagates⁷ trahunt paleas;

causes and essences ol the things inquired into. We have an instance ol
this in the discovery ol that important truth in physical astronomy‚ that
the moon is retained in her orbit by the lorce ol gravity, or the same
which, at the earth's surlace, makes a stone fall to the ground. This pro·
position, however it might have been suspected to be true, could never
have been demonstrated but by such observatione and experiments as
assigned accurate geometrical measures to the quantities compared. The
semidiameter ol the earth; the velocity ol falling bodies at the earth's
suriace; the distance ol the moon, and hervelocity ln her orbitt-all these
four elements must have been determined with great precision, and alter·
wards compared together by certain theorems deduced from the laws os
motion, before the relation between the force which retains the moon in
her orbit, and that which draws a stone to the ground, could possibly be
discovered. The discovery also, when made, oerried with it the evidence
of demonstration3 so that here, as in many other cases, the instantiae radii
are ol the utmost importance in the theoretica] part ol Physics!

Again‚ after speaking, in a passage which is well worth the attention ol the
student, os the generalisations accomplished by the methods ol geometry,
he adds: ‘This can only happen when the experiments afford accurate
measures ol the quantities concemed‚ like the melantiae radri', curriculi,
&c.; and this advantage oladmittinggeneralisation with so much certainty
is one ol their properties, ol which it does not appear that even Bacon
himself was avare!
