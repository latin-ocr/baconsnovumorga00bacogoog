cations'of the Method of Differenoe All other circumstances being the
same, the appearance or disappearance, the erusteme or non-existence of
some one circumstance, or combination of circumstances, enables us to
determine the question at issue.

various examples of ‘instantiae crucis' are adduced by rnyself in my
inductive Logic (4th Ed, pp. 149-152), by Professor Playfair in his
Preliminary Dissertation, by Sir John Herschel in his Discourse on the
Study of Natural Philosophy (§§ 196, 197, 218, 246), and by Dr. Hippus
in his account of the Novum Organum, publisbed by the Society for the
Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. To these 1 must refer the reader, as l
have space for one example only, which l taire from Sir John Herschel:

‘sse discovery of Torricelli was, however, at first much misconceived‚
and even disputed, till the question was finally decided by appeal to a
mcial instance, one of the first, if not the very first on record in physice,
and for which we are indebted to the celebrated Pascal. His acuteness
perceived that if the weight of the incumbent air be the direct cause of
the elevation of the mercury, it must be measured by the amount of that
elevation, and therefore that, by carrying a barometer up a high mountain,
and so ascending into the atmosphere above a large portion of the incum-
bent air, the pressure, as well as the length of the column sustained by it,
must be diminished; while, on the other band, if the phenomenon were
ducto the cause originally assigned, no differenoe could be expected to
take place, whether the observation were made ou a mountain or on the
plain. Perhaps the decisive effect of the experimcnt which he caused to
be instituted for the purpose on the Puy de dee, a high mountain in
nuvergne‚ while it convinced every one of the truth of Torricelli's views,
tended more powerfully than any thing which had previously been done
in science to confirm, in the minds ofruen, that disposition to experimental
velification which had scarcely yet taken full and secure root! Discourse,
dre, § 246. ·

Dr. Hippus draus a very useful distinction between tests or experimenta
crucis which are decisive both ways and those which are what he calls
unilateral:

‘Thus, if a flame burns in any gas submitted to experiment, we may
rougbly (though only roughly) conclude that such gas contains oxygen;
but, if the liame is extinguished, we cannot, therefore, conclude that the
gas contains no oxygen, for the oxygen present may be in too close combi-
nation with some other substance, to enable it to support combustion. But
a perfect test would be weighing any gas ; for if it be beavier than common
air, in the ratio of 1.43 5 to ua, it is exygen3 if lighter or beavier, it is not.
Thus, too, in discussing whether a given writing be innocent or libellous,
that is, maliciously composed, or composed with any improper motive of
any kind, the trutb is aunilateral test; for if the allegatione be false, there
