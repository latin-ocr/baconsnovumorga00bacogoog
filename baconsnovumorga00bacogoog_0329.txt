300 NOVUM ORGANUM.
XCV.

Qui tractaverunt scientias aut empirici aut dogmatici⁷¹
fuerunt. Empirici, formicae more, congerunt tantum, et
utuntur: rationales aranearum more, telas ex se conficiunt:
apis vero ratio media est, quae materiam ex floribus horti
ct agri elicit3 sed tamen eam propria facultate vertit et dige-
rit. Neque absimile philosophiae verum opificium est ; quod
nec mentis viribus tantum aut praecipue nititur, neque ex
historia naturali et mechanicis experimentis praebitam
materiam, in memoria integram, sed in intellectu mutatam et
subactam, reponit. Itaque ex harum facultatum (experi-
mentalis scilicet et rationalis) arctiore et sanctiore foedere
(quod adhuc factum non est) bene sperandum est.

XCVI.

Naturalis philosophia adhuc sincera non invenitur, sed in·
secta et corrupta: in Aristotelis schola, per logicam ⁷², in
Platonis schola, per theologiam naturalem ⁷³3 in secunda
schola⁷⁴ Platonis, Procli et aliorum, per mathematicam

quae philosophiam naturalem terminare, non generare aut ·

procreare debet ⁷⁶. At ex philosophia naturali pura et imper-
mista meliora speranda sunt.

⁷¹ See the Preface to the Novum Orgaoum, and Aphs. 62, 64, 67.

This is one of the best known, and most happily expressed, of Bacon’s
Aphorisms. But, after the explanations already given, it does not appear
to require any annotation. The last sentence shews how far Bacon was
from recommending a merely empirical philosophy.

²² See Aphs. 54, 63, with my notes on them.

²³ See Aph. 65, with my notes. Cp also Aph. 48, so far as it bears on
Final Causes.

⁷⁴ Bacon is alluding to the N coplatonists, though, properly speaking, the
‘secunda schola Platonis’ is the New Academy. On the philosophy of the
Neoplatonists, see Zeller or Ueberweg. The slightest knowledge of their
syspem will shew the justice of Bacon's criticisnr. d

Bacon had conceived‚ though, perhaps, not very clearly, the true relation
between Physics and Mathematics. The most general axioms of Natural
Philosophy were to be carefully established by induction; then, when
they had been stated in a quantitative form, they were to be combined
with each other, and worked out deductively, by means of mathematical
