Bacon’s RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 49

the common people. Let that be left unto the Anabaptists, and other
furies. It was great blasphemy when the devil said, I will ascend and
be like the Hrghest‚· but it is greater blasphemy to personate God,
and bring= him in saying, I wr'll descend, and be like tlte prr'nce of
darkness .· and what is it better, to make the cause of religion to
descend to the cruel and execrable actions of murthering princeS,
butchery of people, and subversion of states and governments?
Surely this is to bring down the Holy Ghost, instead of the like
ness of a dove, in the shape of a vulture or raven; and set out
of the bark oia Christian church a flag of a bark of pirates and
Assassins. Therefore it is most necessary that the church by doctrine
and decree, princes by their sword, and all learnings, both Christian
and moral, as by their Mercury rod, do damn and send to hell for
ever those facts and opinions tending to the support of the same; as
hath been already in good part done. Surely in counsels concerning
religion, that counsel of the apostle would be prefixed, Ira hominis
non implet justiniam Dei. And it was a notable observation of a wise
father, and no less ingenuously confessed; thar those whr'ch held and
persuaded pressure gs consa‘ences, were commonly interessed therer’n them-
selues sor their oron ends!

Here we seem to detect the first note ol the key which was after-
wards struck with such effect by Chillingworth in his Religion of
Protestants, by Jeremy Taylor in his Liberty of Prophesying, and,

above all, by Locke in his Letters on Toleration. And, like these
writers, Bacon probably did not see the consequences of his own
principles. Like them, he would probably have set limits to Tolera·
tion, nor am Ι sure that he would not have set precisely the same

i limits as lecke, namely‚ by excluding ‘Papists' on the one side

x and ‘Atheists' on the other. As in the caseos Locke, too, and,
perhaps, of all who advocated Toleration in those days, when the
true principles of Political Philosophy were so imperfectly understood,
lacon’s zeal against persecution and intolerance arose, probably, in
no srnall measure, from vagueness, uncertainty, or indifference, in his
own religious beliefs

oth. The indifference of which I have just spoken was, I think,
certainly one of Bacon's characteristics in relation to religious con·
troversies. It was not merely that he saw the hollowness or absurdity
of many of the disputes current in his own day. ‘A man that is of
judgrnent and understanding shall sometimes hear ignorant men
differ, and know well within himself that those which so differ mean
one thing, and yet they themselves would never agree? ‘Men create
