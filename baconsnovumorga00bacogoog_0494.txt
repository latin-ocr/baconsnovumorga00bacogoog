LIB. tl. 36. 465

cessavit jacere multos lapillos, per quos surgeret et ascenderet
aqua ut bibere posset; quod postea cessit in proverbium.

Similiter sit natura inquisita Visibile. Videtur omnino
esse divisio vera et certa, lucis, quae est visibile originale et
primam copiam iacit visui, et coloris, qui est visibile secun-
darium et sine luce non cernitur, ita ut videatur nil aliud esse
quam imago aut modificatio lucis ⁷¹. Attamen ex utraque
parte circa hoc videntur esse instantiae faederis: scilicet,
nix⁷² in magna quantitate, et flamma sulphuris ⁷⁸3 in quarum
altera videtur esse color primulum lucens, in altera lux
vergens ad colorem.

²¹ Mr. Ellis refers here to Telesius‚ De Rerum Natura, lib. vii. cap. 31,
the title oi the chapter being ‘Non colorem, sed lucem proprium esse
visus sensile! The correspondence between his language and Bacon's
is not very close, though it is quite possible that, by reflecting on this and
other chapters oi blr. vii, Baeon’s optical theories may have been suggested
to him.

'¹ This isnot reattyan‘instantiatoedertst Snow, like otherwhite bodies,
reflects all the light thrown on it, and is, therefore, more easily visible than
bodies which absorb part oi the light; but it is not, in any sense, an inde·
pendent source ol light, lilre the sun or a fleme.

²³ All flames, not merely that ol sulphur, appear coloured, the particular
tint depending partly on the nature and proportion ot the various sub·
stanees in combustion, partly on the medium through which the flame is
seen. Thus, ilame, being both a source of light and also itsels a coloured
object, might properly be regarded as an ‘instantia foederis.¹

⁷⁴ These are far the most celebrated oi Bacon’s ‘ Praerogativae Instan-
tiamm.' A ‘crucial instance‘ has become a household word in the Eng-
lish language, and is, perhapS, iar more widely used than any other technical
term ol the Inductive Logic. According to the metaphor‚ there are two
or more ways before us, and the observation or experiment in question
acts as a ‘ gulde-post’ (crux) in detenuining us which to take. We have
two or more rival hypotheses, which equally well accord with the facts
hitherto observed‚ and then we think of some decisive experiment or
observation‚ which, by according with one ol the theories, and that only,
will enable us summarily to reject the others. One oi the simplest
and most familiar examples is to be found in chemical processes, as where
we employ a test ior the purpose os determining the nature oi a particular
substance or ol detecting the presence oi a particular poison.

ln logical classification, all cruciat instantes may be regarded as appli-
