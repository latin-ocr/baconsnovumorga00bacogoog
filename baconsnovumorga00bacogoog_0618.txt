¹⁰ This word is opposed to desiccationem. lt is another of the numerous
words employed by Bacon‚ which are not found in classical Latin. Nor
is it recognised by Du Cange.

¹¹ Cp. Historia Densi et Rari, E. and S., vol. ii. p. 295 ; New Atlantis,
E. and S., vol. iii. p. 157. Mr. Ellis refers to Marco Polo, 11. 77. ln
Marsden's Translation of Marco Polo (London, 1818), the passage runs as
follows: ‘They collect a certain kind of earth, as it tvere from a mine,
and,1aying it in a great heap, suffer it to be exposed to the wind, the rain,
and the sun, for thirty or forty years, during which time it is never dis·
turbed. By this it becomes relined and fit for being wrought into the
vessels above mentioned. Such colours as may be thought proper are
then laid on, and the ware is afterwards balred in ovens or tumaces.
Those persons therefore who cause 1113 331111 to be dug, collect it for their
children or grandchildren! For the original, see Ramusio’s collection:
‘Navigationi et Viaggi,’ vol. ii. p. 49. The chapter is there numbered
as 79.

From the general resemblance between what Bacon says 3ηά 1113 pas-
sage in Marco Polo, l can entertain little doubt that he had read· tt, or
some account taken from' 11. Eut, on the main point, it will be seen, the
passages are. discordant

One of the numerous derivatione of poroelain ts the oddone ‘pour cent
anne'es3' ‘because it was believed by Europeans, that 1113 materials of
porcelain were matured under ground one hundred years! Dr. Johnson’s
Dictionary. Cp. Sir Thomas Browne's Vulgar Errors, bk. ii. ch.5
(Fickenngs Ed, vol. ii. pp. 352-4l. Several authorities are there cited
both for and against this ‘common belief.¹

ln Col. Yule's Edition of Marco Polo, 1113 passage given above is re-
jected as an interpolation of Ramusio. Commenting on 11, Col. Yule says :
‘This story of the life-long period during which the porcelain clay was
exposed to temper long held rts ground, and probably was only dispelled
by the publication of the details of the King· te-ching manttfactureby Pera
