motus communi et inveterata opinione habetur pro proprio
coelestium. Attamen gravis de illo motu lis est inter non·
nullos tam ex antiquis quam modernis, qui rotationem terrae
attribuerunt. At multo sortasse justior⁶⁰ movetur controversia
(si modo res nou sit omnino extra controversiam), an motus

videlicet iste (concesso quod terra stet) coeli finibus conti-
neatur, an potius descendat, et communicetur aeri et aquis ⁶¹.
Motum autem rotationis in missilibus, ut in spiculis, sagittis,
pilis sclopetorum‚ et similibus, omnino ad motum libertatis
rejicimus ⁶².

(18) Sit Motus Decimus Octavus Motus Τ repedationis, cui
(ut ab astronomis intelligitur) non multum fidei adhibemus ⁶³.
Nobis autem corporum naturalium appetitus ubique serio
perscrutantibus occurrit iste motus; et constitui debere videtur
inspeciem. Est autem hic motus veluti aeternae cujusdam
captivitatis. Videlicet ubi corpora non omnino pro natura
sua bene locata, et tamen non prorsus male se habentia,

to circular motion, that is, unless we reject the sixth and seventb species
of variation, it will not be necessary lor us to suppose the poles themselves
to be movable: in other words, that the pheuomena ol which we could
by this hypothesis give an account maybe adequately represented without
it by means oi spiralsl

⁶⁰ This language, the reader will perceive, exactly accords with what
we have so often elsewhere found to be Bacou's opinion not only as to the
annual, but also as to the diurnal motion oi the earth.

⁸³ ‘The name ul trepidation was given by the Alphonsine astronomers
toa motion by which they imagined the starry heaven to be affected, and
in virtue ol which its equinuxes described small circles oi niue degrees
radius about those ol the ninth or next superior orb. To account lor this
motion they introduced a tenth orb. The pheuomenon, however, thus
accounted ior was altogether imaginary, although it is true that the length
of the tropical year, by supposed variations of which the idea ot trepi-
tion was suggested, is not rigorously constant. lt may be questioned
whether Bacou's hesitation to accept the astronomical motion of trepi-
dation had any better foundation than his doubts whether the proper
motious ol the planetary orbs were anything more than “res confictae et
suppositae.'’ [See Aph. 36 (2).] The question ol the existence
or non-existence ol trepidation could only be decided by a person
conversam with the details os the received system oi anonomyt Mr.
Ellis' note.
