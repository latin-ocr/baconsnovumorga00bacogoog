3¹0 NOVUM ORGANUM.

qui ad excutiendas⁵ definitiones et ideas⁶ hac certe forma

inductionis aliquatenus utitur. Verum ad hujus inductionis,
sive demonstrationis 7, instructionem bonam et legitimam
quamplurima adhibenda sunt, quae adhuc nullius mortalium
cogitationem subiere3 adeo ut in ea major sit consumenda
opera, quam adhuc consumpta est in syllogismo Β. Atque
hujus inductionis auxili0, non solum ad axiomata invenienda,

means two different things. In the Temporis Partus Masculus, be is
alluding probably to what is usually understood by the Platonic or
Socratic Induction, the ἐπακτικοὶ λόγος or παραβολή, which (except in the
lact that it generally argues irum a number oi instances, instead oi
generally arguing from a single instance) answers to the Example (παρό-
διιγμα) oi Aristotle. For an account ol this mode oi reasouing, see the
Introduction to Mansel’s Edition oi Aldrich‚ 4th ed, p. xx. But the
‘forma inductionis' to which Bacon alludes in this Aphorism is un·
doubtedly the Method oi Exclusion, as practised by Plato. When he
wishes to settle the meaning oi a term, his usual method (oi which we
may see an excellent instance, witb regard to δικαιοσύνη, in the tst book of
the Republic) is to bring iorward a number ol interlocutors, who, one alter
the other, make the attempt; each, in histum, is related, generally by an
application of the Socratic παραβολή, or induction in the sense just de·
scribed3 then, the question is either leit unsettled (as in the Euthyphron),
or Socrates himself pmposes a definition, which is accepted as final. But,
ii the affirmative Socrates stands his ground, it is only because, as Mr.
Grote says, there is no negative Socrates to crosa-question him. ln lact,
this allusion to tbe Platonic Method oi Rejection brings into promineuoe
the obJections to the method generally. How can we be certain that all
the possible delinitions have been started, and what guarantce have we
oi the correctness oi theone which is ultimately adopted?

⁶ This word implies both discussion and determination.

⁸The word, 1 think, bere stands for the illim of Plato. Its use as
=notiones, was, before the time ol David Buchanan and Descartes, ex·
ceedingly rare. See Hamilton on Reid, Appendix, Note G, where the
student will find a most interesting account oi the history oi the word.
In Aph. 23 and elsewhere, Bacon uses it in its scholastic sense, as appro-
priated to the forms oi the Divine Minu, ‘divinae mentis ideae! See note
29 onAph 23.

² Bacon probably uses this term, usually appropriated to mathematical
prooi, osset purpose. He conceived, and conceived, l think, rightly, that
Induction, if properly conducted, is capable oi affording evidence positively
certain. Cp. the Distributio Operis, p. 172, ‘inductionem enim censemus
earn esse demonstrandi lormam,’ etc

³ Any one acquainted with the subsequent history oi scientific discovery
and scientific method will admire the wonderful ioresight displayed by
Bacon in this sentence.
