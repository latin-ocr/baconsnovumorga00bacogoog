124 INTRODUCTION.

At the end of the third book of the Optics (Horsley's Ed, vol. iv.
pp. 26 3, 264), there is a longer and fuller passage, much to the same
effect:

‘Asin Mathematicks, so in Natural Philosophy, the investigation
oi difficult things by the method os analysis⁴⁶ ought ever to precede
the methodos composition. This analysis consists in making ex-
periments and observations, and in drawing general conclusions from
them by induction, and admitting os no objections against the con-
clusions, but such as are taken from experimenta, or other certain
truths. For hypotheses are not to be regarded in Experimental
Philosophy. And although the arguing from experiments and ob·
servatione by induction beno demonstration of general conclusions3
yet it is the best way of arguing which the nature os things admits ol,
and may be looked upon as so much the sironger‚ by how much the
induction is more general. And it no exception occur from phac·
nomena, the conclusion may be pronounced generally. But il at any
time afterwards any exception shall occur from experiments; it may
then begin to be pronounced, with such exceptions as occur. By
this way of analysis we may proceed stom compounds to ingredi·
ents; and from motions to the forces producing them; and, in
general, from effects to their causes; and from particular causes
to more general ones, till the argument end in the most general.
This is the method of Analysis. And the Synthesis consists in
assuming the causes discovered and established as principles, and by
them explaining the phaenomena proceeding stom them, and proving
the explanations.'

This passage, while undoubtedly shewing, as it seems to me,
an acquaintance with the Baconian method, is remarkable as denying
to induction the soree os demonstration (a limitation which we may,
perhaps, account sor stom Newton’s mathematical habit os mind and
the preponderance ol his mathematical pursuits), as well as sor the
lact that it does not appear to recognise any other torm ol induction
than that ‘per enumerationem simplicem' Both these circumstances
incline me to believe that Newton had not studied, or did not
remember, or did not accept the teaching oi the early part of the
Second Book os the Novum Organum, though the precepts and
warnings ol the F irst Book, in their most general torm, had produced
