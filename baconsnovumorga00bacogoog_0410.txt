²⁸ This remark is interesting, as connected with the experiment which
was the occasion of Bacon's death. On a cold morning in the spring of
1626, he descended from his coach at the bottom of Highgate Hill, bought
a hen of a poor woman, and stuffed it with snow. The chill, to which
he was thus exposed, brought on an attack ol what we should now call
bronchitis, of which he died on the 9th of April.

²⁸ This effect, which is, of course, only apparent, is due to the escape of
gases. With certain very rare exceptions, the invariable effect of any aug·
mentation of temperatura is to expand, not to contract, a body.

²⁷ As l have pointed out before, Bacon did not see the true relation of
heat and cold, but regarded the latter as a positive quality. There is no
systematic ‘Inquisitio de F rigido' in his works. The nearest approaches
to it are ‘Experiments in consort touclring the production of cold' in the
Sylva Sylvarum, Century ἰ. 69-75 (E. and S., vol. ii. pp. 370-1), and a
Fragment entitled ‘Sequela Cartarum, sive Inquisitio Legitima de Calore
et F rigore’ (E. and S., vol. iii. pp. 644-52).

²⁸ The language here used of F orm exactly corresponds with that which
might be used ol the scholastic temr ‘Essence,' or of the ‘Real Essence'
of Locke. There is, perhaps, no passage in tbe Novum Organum, in
which we could less appropriately replace the word by ‘Law' or ‘Causa'
