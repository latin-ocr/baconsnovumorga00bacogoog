Nullo modo fieri potest, ut axiomata per argumentationem
constituta ad inventionem novorum operum valeant; quia
subtilitas naturae subtilitatem argumentandi multis partibus
superat. Sed axiomata, a particularibus rite et ordine ab·
stracta, nova particularia rursus facile indicant et designant³⁰;
itaque scientias reddunt activas.

XXV.

Axiomata‚ quae in usu sunt, ex tenni et manipulari expe·
rientia, et paucis particularibus, quae nt plurimum occurmnt,
fluxere3 et sunt iere ad mensuram eorum facta et extensa:

in mundo, quod non aliquid in mente Dei latens idealiter exprimat!
One, though probably not the true, interpretation oi the ideal doctrine
oi Plato is that the tria are simply the ideas or typical forms existing
in the mind oi God.

By the concluding words of the Aphorism, Bacon probably intends to
intimate, as Dr. Kitchin says, ‘that it would be futile ior Man to en·
deavour to contemplate any thing abstracted from, and out oi its
connexion with, the material world,’ that, in lact, our only mode ol
ascertaining the ideas oi the divine mind is the patient study oi the
Book oi Nature. Tm Aphorism might be paraphrased thus: God is
omniscient; Nature is the reflexion of the mind of God. Man, led
astray hythe phantasms in his own mind, has vainly imagined that he
can attain to knowledge, without going to Nature and therein studying
the image oi the divine mind. Cp. Aph. 124.

³⁰ Except ior the implied limitation to opera, this is the true conception
of the relations oi the lnductive and Deductive methods. When the
axioma have been constituted by inductiorr, they should be developed
deductively into all their consequentes and then ultimately, ii they admit
oi it, applied to practice. The science oi Mechanics affords an excellent
instance oi a science thus constituted, developed, and applied.

The word ‘abstracta' as the equivalent oi ‘inserted by induction' is
worthy oi notice. The qualities in which a number oi individual objects
agree are regarded as ‘drawn from’ them, to the exclusion oi those in
which they diti‘er, and, therefore, as predicable, in an axiom or proposi-
tion, οἱ the class as a whole. Properly speaking, however, the word
‘abstracted' ought to be applied, not to the qualities on which the attention
is concentrated, but to those which are withdrawn from consideration.
Attention and Abstraction are processes the reverse oi and complementary
to each other.
