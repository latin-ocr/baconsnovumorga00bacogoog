TESTIMONIES TO BACON'S INFLUENCE. 109

alludes to Bacon ¹⁸. In the Scienza Nuova (in its second form), lib. ii.
(Worlrs, Milan Ed os 1836, vol. v. p. 253), he bears this testimony:
‘Onde a gran ragione 11 Verulamio, gran filosofo egualmente e poli·
tico, propone, commenda ed illustra l’Induzione nel suo Organ05
et e seguito tuttavia dagli Inghilesi con gran srutto della Sperinrentale
Filososra’ I aru indebted sor this reference to Μ. de Remusat, who
cites the French translation published in 1844, p. 165.

Mr. Napier‚ with the most commendable industry, collects the
German and Dutch testimonies to Bacon from the Franksort Edition
oi Campanella's Realis Philosophia Epilogistiea by Tobias Adams in
1623 down to the Compendium Historiae Philosophicae ol Buddaeus,
published in 17 31· In the Preiace to the first-mentioned boolr, the
aim and method of Campanella are compared with those os Bacon,
‘sagacissimus Philosophus’ (who, it must be remembered, was still
alive, and working at the Instauratio Magna), ‘quamvis non dubitem
quin longe plura et majora per inductiones diligentiores, quibus ille
insistit, investigari, multaque emendari et elucidari rectius possint.²
The next authority to which Μ1. Napier resers is Comenius's Sy·
nopsis Physicae ad lumen divinum resonnatae, published in 1⁶43·
This author, who speaks of Bacon (‘magnus Verulamius’) in his
Preface with the greatest respect, also couples him with Campanella:
‘hos enim Hercules, qui debellandis monstris expurgandisque Augiae
stabulis feliciter admoverunt manus, commonstrasse, et illis, quos
Aristotelicae vane turgidae Philosophiae dementatos tenet authoritas,
opposuisse, sufficiat' And, again, he describes the Instauratio Magna
as ‘opus suspiciendum et quod ego non aliter quarn lucidissimum
exorientis novi saeculi Phosphorum intueri soleo.’

The educational works, it may be added, of the last author (b. in
Moravia 1592, d. 1671, many os whose writings were published at
Leszno in Polandl are full ol allusions to Bacon, and it is carious
to note how strikingly Baconian in character are many ot his thoughts
and modes of expression ²¹. 11 any reader cares to pursue this sub-
ject, he will find an excellent example of what I mean 11 the Pan·

²⁴ ‘In the ‘⁴ De Ratione Studiorum.”' says Professor Flint (Vico, p. 31), ⁸ the
mflueuce ol Bacon's “ De Augmentis Scientiarum '¹ is very apparent. At the tirne
oi writiug it, he had been lor sometime acquainted with Bacon's writings, and had
conoeived t'or them high admiration. Their author he pronounces ⁸⁴ an incompar-
able man.’' Paeon-as powersnlly attracted as Descartes repelled him.'

'¹ 1 arn indebted to the late Μ1. Marlr Pattison lor first directing my attention to

these laenwith regard to Comen'nrs.
