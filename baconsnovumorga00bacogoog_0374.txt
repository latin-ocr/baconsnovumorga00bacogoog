Whatever may be our opinion as to tbe nature ol Causation, or the
ultimate analysis of the idea oi Causc, this maxim is undoubtedly true3
we cannot truly know a thing, unless we know its antecedents and con·
ditions.

¹⁰ On the Four Causes ol Aristotle, see Introduction, § 8, n. 34,

¹¹ ln the actions ol men, we must, of course, take account oi F inal
Causes. We know by experience that men always or generally act, con-
sciously or unconsciously, witb some end in view. Hence, to understand
their acts, we must enquire into their airus lt is lrom supposing that
Nature always, in like manner, bas some end in view, from an analogy, in
lact, between man and nature, that the theory ol Final Causes bas been
extended to Physics.

On the subject os final Causes generally, and Bacon’s criticism oi the
doctrine, see Introduction, ξ 10.

¹² Cp. Bk. i. Aph. 75.

²³ Heis probably alluding here to the ny, or shapeless matter, potentially
all things and actually nothing, ol the Aristotelians, and to the habit oi
referring natural events and processes to God or Nature as the First
Cause, instead oi secking to ascertain the second and proximare Efficient
Causea. The proximate efficient cause with Bacon would be the latens
processus, and the proximate material cause the latens schematismus. A
knowledge oi such causes, he thought, would increase our power over
nature, whereas the various speculatione about the more remote causes
appertained, he conceived, not to physics, but to theology and (sofar
as be recognised any such science) metaphysics.
