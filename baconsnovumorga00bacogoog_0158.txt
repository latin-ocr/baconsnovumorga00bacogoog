NATURE OF BACON’S INFLUENCE ΟΝ SCIENCE. 129

butio Operis, p. 168. ‘Vemm ad hujus inductionis, sive demonstra-
tionis, instructionem bonam et legitimam quamplurima adhibenda
sunt, quae adhuc nullius mortalium cogitationem subiere; adeo ut
in ea major sit consumenda opera, quam adhuc consumpta est in
syllogismo! Novum Organum, Ble 1. Aph. ¹05· As I have said
elsewhere⁵¹, ‘Inductive Logic, that is, the systematic analysis and
arrangement of inductive evidence, as distinct from the natural in·
duction which all men practise, is almost as much the creation of
Bacon as Deductive Logic is that of Aristotle. It must, however, be
acknowledged that the one lest fir more to be added and remodelled
by his successors than did the other.'

yth, But to this Logic of Induction I maintain that Bacon himself
made no contemptible contributione. lhat our instances require to
be selected and not merely accumulated, was a very true and a very
needful lesson which he was never weary of repeating. And, surely,
in this maxim consists the whole gist of the Inductive Logic. On
what principles we shall select our instances, and by what means vve
shall satisfy ourselves of their sufficiency, are other and further ques
tions, confessedly most difficult to ansver, ou which we could hardly
expect much detailed or permanently useful information froma
pioneer in this method of inquiry. And yet Bacon is very fnll on
at least the first of these questions, and much of what he says has,
even still,avalue for the student. But we are, in this section,concemed,
we must recollect, not with the present value of his works, but with
their past influence. Now, to the amount of that influence, with respect
to the subiect before us, what better testimony can we have than the
repetition of these rules in the next generation by so eminent a man
of science as Dr. Robert Hooke, or the appropriation, emendation,
and fonnulation of thern, ns the bases of their own methods, almost
within our own time, by Sir John Herschel and Mr. Mill? Nor is it
an unimportant consideration that such phrases as ‘glaring instance,
‘crucial instance,' ‘clandestine instance,' ‘solitary instance,' and the
like, have become household words in our language, and especially in
the vocabulary of scientific men.

scientific enquiries to practical aims, namely, the furtherance of man’s

estate and the increase of his command over the comforts and con-

Second Edition. But, though, in my first Edition‚1 seem nowhere explicitly to
heve munciated what 1 regard aa the distinctive feature in Bucon’s reform of logie,
the conception underlies nearly all that 1 have said on the subject.
