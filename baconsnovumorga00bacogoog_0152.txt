RELATION OF NEWT ΟΝ TO BACON. 123'

(see pp. 56-62l. I can only giv'e one or two brief extracts. ‘Sir
Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam, who was cotemporary with Galileo
and Kepler, is justly held amongst the restorers os true learning, but
more especially the founder of experimental philosophy! * * ⁸ ²⁸ *
‘He proposed his plan in his Instauratio Magna, with so much
strength of argument, and so just a real, as renders that admirable
work the delight of all who have a taste sor solid leaming.' * * * * *
In his Novum Organum ‘his chief design is to shew how to make
a good induction, as Aristotle’s was to teach how to make agood
syllogism. Had the philosophers‚ since Lord Vemlam's time, adhered
more closely to his plan, their success had been greater: and Sir
Isaac Newton’s philosophy had not found the learned so full of
prejudices against it, in favour of some systems lately invented and
mightily ortolled by speculative men ; that, while all admired the
sublime geometry which shone throughout his work, few for some
time appeared to be disposed to hearken to his philosophy, or in a =
condition to judge of it impartially. However, Lord Bacon's ex·
hortations and example had a good effect; and experimental philo
sophy has been much more cultivated since his' time than in any
preceding period. Geometry and philosophy advanced together at
a great pace, and gave mutual aid to each other!

Though Newton's works contain no direct reference to Bacon,
there are passages which make it very difficolt to suppose that he
was not acquainted with, at least, the first book os the Novum
Organum either through his own reading or through the common
tradition of its teaching. Of the Regulae Philosophandi (contained
in Horsley’s Edition of Newton's Worlrs, vol. iii. pp. 2-4), the third
has already been referred to in my extract from Pemberton. But,
for our present purpose, the fourth is still more to the point. It
runs as follows:

‘In Philosophia experimentali, Propositiones ex phaenomenis per
inductionem collectae, non obstantibus contrariis hypothesibus, pro
veris aut accurate, aut quam proxime, haberi debent, donec alia
occurrerint Phaenomena, per quae aut accuratiores reddantur, aut
exceptionibus obnoxiae!

‘Hoc lieri debet, ne argumentum inductionis tollatur per hy-
potheses.'

This rule, both in substance and expression, is thoroughly Baconian,
and, I venture to suggest, could hardly have been stated as it is by
any one not acquainted with the Baconian philosophy.
