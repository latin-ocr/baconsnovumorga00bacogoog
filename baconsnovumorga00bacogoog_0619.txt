Aditus ad Historiam sulphuris, Mercurii, et Salis (E. and S, ii. pp. 82-3).
⁴⁸ As opposed to volatile. See last note.

⁴⁷ The idea of ‘ quaternions' is still further and more clearly developed
in the Aditus ad Historiam Sulphuris, dcc, just referred to. There, he.
regards sulphur and mercury, which properly belong to the subterranean
world, as taking the forms respectively of oil and water in the animal and
vegetable world, of flame and air respectively ‘in pneumaticis inferioribus,’
and, lastly (though on this point he does not pronounce decisively), of starry
matter and pure aether respectively ‘in coelestibus? Salt he regards as
compounded of sulphur and mercury, by means of a strong spirit. The
reader should carefully compare this ‘Aditus’ with the present passage,
and with what was said about the Triad in the last note but one.

l have not been able to find in the works of Paracelsus any single
passage or any combination of passages containing the precise theory
propounded in the text. But the following quotations, which are neces-
sarily very brief, will show that much of this nonsense was either derived
directly from Paracelsus, or indirectly suggested hy his works:

‘Sulphurum multa sunt: Resina, Gummi, Botin [id est TerpentinaJ,
Axungia, pinguedo, butyrum, oleum, vinum ardens, &cl

‘Scitote ergo, salia multa esse. Quaedam sunt calces: quaedam cineres:
quaedam Arsenicalia: quaedam Antimonicalia, &c' Op. Omn. vol. i.
v· 36³⁴

‘Sal albus est: et omnes in se colores habet. Sulphur ardet ldeo
omnia olea continet. Mercurius diffluit. Ergo omnes in se humores
claudit. Et sic de caeteris quoque, quae ad philosophiam remittimus!
i. p. 52b.

‘ Pinguedo autem quaevis nihil est aliud quam sulphur modis ac naturis
variis divisum* s s Videtis nimirum per tempestates coelum fulgurare.
lsto autem loco sulphur nullum videri potest. Et tamen curn ardeat, id
necessario a solo sulphure lit' i. 71oa.

Even these absurdities are outdone by the quaint theory of Paracelsus
about the stars (and here Bacon ceases to follow) : ‘Sydera omnia Hyemis
vivunt in Mercurio, et sydera omnia aestatis in sulphure, et juxta se in·
vicem ita manent jugiter! i. 824 b.

1 cannot but think that Bacon, in his modifications of the doctrine oi
Paracelsus, was influenced by the theory of Telesius, deriving all ¹things
from heat and cold ; sulphur would answer to the former, mercury to the
latter. The manner in which Bacon constructs his ‘Quaternions’ would
certainly support this hypothesis.
