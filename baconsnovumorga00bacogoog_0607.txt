(3) At tertius ex septem modis refertur ad magnum illud
organum, tam naturae quam artis, quoad operandum3 videlicet
calidum et frigidum. Atque in hac parte claudicat plane
potentia humana, tanquam ex uno pede. Habemus enim ca·
lorem ignis, qui caloribus solis (prout ad nos deferuntur) et
caloribus animalium quasi infinitis partibus potentior est et
intensior. At deest frigus ⁸, nisi quale per tempestates
hyemales, aut per cavernas, aut per circundationes nivis et
glaciei, haberi potest: quod in comparatione aequari potest
cum calore sortasse solis meridiano in regione aliqua ex
torridis aucto insuper per reverberationes montium et pa-
rietum3 nam hujusmodi utique tam calores quam frigora
ab animalibus ad tempus exiguum tolerari possunt. Nihili
autem sunt iere prae calore iomacis ardentis, aut alicujus
frigoris quod huic gradui respondeat. ltaque omnia hic apud

⁷ This remark has, no doubt, reference to Bacnn's theory of the Trans-
mutability ol the Elements. See Aph. 48 (1 ι), with notes. But there is
a certain sense in which his anticipation has been verified. For we now
know that water might be produced, by means of cold and compression
alone, from its constituent gasest, hydrogen aud oxygen. ln fact, as
already pointed out, all aerilorm fluids are merely liquids kept in the state
ns vapour hy heat, and a sufficient amount os cold and pressure will reduce
them into the liquid state. See note 37 on Aph. 33.

⁸ Bacon, it need hardly be repeated, regarded coldas a distinct quality
stom heat, not merely as a lower degree of it. The expression ‘variations
of temperature,’ had it existed in his time, might, as 1 have already pointed
out, have preserved him from this error.

The greatest cold known is produced by the evaporation os liquefied
gases. ‘By surrounding the gas under experiment by concentric tubes
containing liquid oxygen, which in turn is surrounded by liquid ethylene‚
Olszewski obtained temperaturas low enough to solidiiy nitrogen‚ carbonic
oxide, marsh gas, and nitric oxide. The evaporation ol solid nitrogen
under a pressure of 4¹¹²¹¹ss produces a temperature of —225⁰ (C.= — 373 Κ).

⁰ Here again (cp. Aph. 48 (12), (19) l he alludes to his theory of the
rapidly increasing density ol bodies, as we approach the centre oi the
earth.
