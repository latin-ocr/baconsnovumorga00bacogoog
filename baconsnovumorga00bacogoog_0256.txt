⁸² This idea of ⁸ spirits' shut up in bodies, inanimate as well as animate,
is of frequent occurrence in the and Book. See, for instance, the 7th and
40th Aphorisrns, where some of the statements and speculations are very
curious. Immediately horrowed, perhaps, from Paracelsus, or taken gene-
rally from the physical philosophy of the day, this doctrine seems to
have had a peculiar attraction for Bacon. ‘The idea,’ says Mr. Ellis
(Preface to the Historia Vitae et Mortis. E. and S.‚ vol. ii. p. 94), ‘on
which Bacon's theory of longevity is founded, namely, that the principle of
life resides in a subtle fluid or spirit which permeates the tangible parts of
the organisation of plants 3ηά animab, seems to be coeval with the first
origin of speculative physiology. Bacon was one of those by whom this
idea was extended from organised to inorganic bodies : in all substances,
according to him, resides 3 portion of spirit which manifests itself only in
its operations, being altogether intangible 3ηά without weight. This
doctrine appeared to him to be of most certain truth, but he has nowhere
stated the grounds of his conviction, nor even indicated the kind of

ἵ evidence by which the existence of the spiritus is to be established. In

living bodies he conceived that two kinds of spirits exist: a crude or
mortuary spirit, such as is present in other substances; and the animal
or vital spirit, to which the phenomena of life are to be referred. To
keep this vital spirit, the wine of life, from oozing away, ought to be the
aim of the physician who attempts to increase the number of our lew and
evil days!

This physical, or rather metaphysical, theory of a subtle, invisible, and
intangible fluid or ether, permeating every material substance, whether
animate or inanimate, may be regarded as a curious survival of a primi·
tive, fetichistic era, when men literally believed that every object around
thern was animated or possessed by a soul or ⁴ spirit' similar to their own,
and that this soul or spirituas itself a material, though itmight be an
invisible, substance. The student will find some most interesting and
suggestive remarks on this subject in Dr. Tylor’s Primitive Cultura, vol. ii.
chs. 14, ις.

⁸³ Bacon appears to have adopted a theory of the ultimate constitution
of matter, in some respects similar to that of the Atomists (see especially
Bk. ii. Aph. 8); 3ηά hence his partiality for the vschool of Democritus.
He rejected, however, the hypothesis of a vacuum, and it does not appear
whether his atoms (or rather particles, as he preferred to call them)
differed in material or only in shape and arrangement. Any way, all mate·
rial objects, he conceived, if only we could penetrate to their ultimate
structure or constitution, would he found to consist of a number of small
particles, arranged in some definite manner with reference to each other.
This arrangement, as it escapes detection, is called Latens Schematismus,
and any change in it is termed Mela-Schematrsmus; moreover, as the
