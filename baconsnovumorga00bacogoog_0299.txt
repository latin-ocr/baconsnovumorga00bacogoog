Quod vero putant homines, in philosophia Aristotelis
magnum utique consensum esse; cum post illam editam
antiquorum philosophiae cessaverint et exoleverint3 ast apud
tempora, quae sequuta sunt, nil melius inventum fuerit3 adeo
ut illa tam bene posita et fundata videatur, ut utrumque
tempus ad se traxerit: prim0, quod de cessatione antiquarum
philosophiarum post Aristotelis opera edita homines cogitant,
id falsum est; diu enim postea, usquead tempora Ciceronis
et secula sequentia, manserunt opera veterum philosophorum ⁷.
Sed temporibus insequentibus, ex inundatione Barbarorum in
imperium Romanum, postquam doctrina humana velut nau·
fragium perpessa esset; tum demum philosophiae Aristotelis
et Platonis, tanquam tabulae ex materia leviore et minus
solida, per fluctus temporum servatae sunt ⁸. Illud etiam de
consensu fallit homines, si acutius rem introspiciant. Verus
enim consensus is est, qui ex libertate judicii (re prius ex-
plorata) in idem conveniente consistit ⁹. At numerus longe
maximus eorum, qui in Aristotelis philosophiam consenserunt,
ex praejudicio et authoritate aliorum se illi mancipavit: ut
sequacitas sit potius et coitio, quam consensus ¹⁰. Quodsi

⁷ This statement is proved not only by the citations in Cicero, but also
by the work of Diogenes Laertius, which, though of uncertain date, is
placed by some authorities as late as the time of Constantine the Great,
as well as by the references in the Christian Fathers of the third and
fourth centuries.

⁸ See note 89 on Aph. 71.

⁹ There are really three conditions of ‘verus consensus,' of which Bacon
enumerates only the two last, taking probably the first for granted:

( 1) The judges must be competent ;

(2) The matter in question must have been thoroughly examined, before
judgment is pronounced;

(3) The consent must be free, that is to say, the judges must not have
been influenced by each other.

On the abuse and limlts of the arguments from Authority and from
Universal consent, see my Inductive Logic, 4th ed, pp. 287-295.

¹⁰ There is a story of the late Bishop Thirlwall that, on one occasion,
distinguishing between the few competent and the many incompetent
signatories of a memorial, he described the latter as so many ciphers after
a decimal point
