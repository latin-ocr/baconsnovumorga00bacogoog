evidently complicated by the consideration of the proper motions of the
planels and comets.

Dr. Whewell, who comments at some length on this example (History
oi the Inductive Sciences, 3rd Ed, Additions, vol. i. pp. 388-39ol, adduces
it as showing that Bacon, at least in his later years, was not so much
opposed, as is commonly thought, to the Copemican theory. ‘With
regard to the diurnal motion oi the earth,' he says, ‘it would seem as
ii Bacon himself had a leaning to believe it when he wrote this passage;
ior neither is he himself, nor are any of the Anti-Copemicans, accustomed
to assert that the immensely rapid motion ol the sphere of the Fixed Stars
graduales by a slower and slower motion os Planets, Comets, nirano
Ooean, into the immobility oi the Earth. So that the conditions are not
satisfied on which he hypothetically says, “tum abnegandus est motus
terrae.”’ l must consess, however, that l cannot take so favourable a
view. See Aph. 46, where, speaking ol the enormous velocity implied by
the diurnal motion oi the heavens, he says, ‘quae etiam viros graves ita
obstupefecit, ut mallent credere motum terrae,’ evidently regarded as an
extreme supposition. Cp. also the end oi the next paragraph oi that
Aphorism, and Aph. 35, where, in discussing rest and motion, he says,
‘statio, sive quies, videtur competere globo ipsi terrae.’

ln the Introduction, Section 6, Bacon’s attitude to the Copemican
theory is discussed at some length. We must, os course, distinguish the
passages in which he speaks ol the diurnal from those in which he speaks
ol the annual motion oi the earth. But that Whewell’s argument, as
derived from the passage in the text, is delusive, is plain from comparing
a corresponding passage in the De Fluxu et Relluxu Maris (E. aud S.,
vol. iii. p. 53), where Bacon states dogmatically that it is an invariable
rule that, the nearer a body approaches the earth, the slower is its motion
oi rotation.

lt may he worth noticing that Telesius (De Rerum Natura, i. 3) insists
on the motion oi the air, testing the position partly on authority and
partly on the sound produced by putting the hand or a hom to the ear.
Bacon recurs to the motion ol the air and water in ii. 48 (17), where he
seems to entertain no doubt on the subject.

⁸³ -‘ Th'e astronomers,' Bacon often says, ‘ insist on explaining the retarda-
tion ol the inferior orbs by giving them a proper motion oi their own,
opposite to that which they derive from the starry heaven: surely it would
be simpler to say that all the orbs move in the same direction with unequal
velocities; the inequality depending on their remoteness lrom the prime
