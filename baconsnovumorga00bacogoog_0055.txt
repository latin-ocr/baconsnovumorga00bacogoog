‘This list, for which I arn entirely indebted to Mr. Ellis's prefaces
and notes, might probably be increased ; but the instances enumerated

‚ are sufficient to shew not only that Bacon was ill read in the history

of these branches of learning (and yet it was in this direction
that science was making the most real and rapid advances), but
also that upon such subjects his ideas were not clear ; this latter
defect being no doubt the cause of the other; for where he could not
readily follow the steps of the investigation, he could hardly appreciate
the value of the result’

To this list, fonnidable as it is, might be added a number of
beliefs in which Bacon was certainly not superior to the current
opinions of his time. Thus, he is evidentlya believer, not only in
Natural but Judicial Astrology, though, it must be owned, with a
certain amount of hesitation and discrimination. See-the long
and remarkable passage in De Augmentis‚ lib. iii. cap. 4 (E. and S,
vol. i. pp. 5 54-560). A ter beginning with the very true remark, ‘At

Astrologia multa superstitione referta est, ut vix aliquid sanum in ea
reperiatur,’ and rejecting various branches of the pretended science,
he, nevertheless, allows that the study of the stars may enable us to
predict not only natural eventS, like floods, frosts, droughts, earth·
quakes, dte, but ‘wars, seditions, schisms, transmigrations of peoples‚
and, in short, all commotions or great revolutions of things, natural
as well as civil' ‘Neque Electiones prorsus rejiciendae sunt; sed
parcius illis quarn Praedictionibus fidendum. Videmus enim in planta-
tionibus et seminationibus et insitionibus, aetatum lunaeobservationes
non esse res omnino frivolas⁵⁸.'

To the curious and absurd speculations on ‘spirit’ which abound
in the Novum Organum and elsewhere, and many of which seem to
have been derived from Paracelsus, I shall frequently have occasion
to call attention in the notes. A typical passage may be found in
Novum Organum‚ ii. 40.

the above quotation, 1 have invadably preserved Mr. Spedding's fect-notes, or
rather references, giving my own additions within brackets.

affectus lunae, et passiones corpomm inferiorum, prout exexperimeutis agriculturae,
nauticae, et medicinae, aut alias, cum delectu severo et sincero colligi et recipi
possint.¹
