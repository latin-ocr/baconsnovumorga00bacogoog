monstrable knowledge, and δόξα, mere opinion, there is a third and
intermediate kind os knowledge, quite trustworthy, but not demonstrable.
This was called φαντασία ιαταληττικί] or κατάληψις. According to the
Stoics‚ says Tennemann, ‘every original representation is the result oi
impressions produced upon the mind, and hence ol sensational perceptions ;
aud is therefore denominated φαντασία, visum. Out ol these original and
sensational impressions, Reason, a superior and directing power (τὸ ἡγι-
μανικόν), forms our other representatione. The true are styled by Zeno
φαντασίαι ταταληττικαί, or καταλήψεις, that is, such as are verified hy their
correspondence with the object to which they refer, are ireely assented
to, arrd constitute the foundation of sciense! The greater part of our
physical and ethical knowledge tlre Stoics held to be os this intermediate
description. ln opposition to this theory, the philosophers of the New
Academy maintained the doctrine oi ἀκαταληψία, that is the impossibiliry
os attaining to such καταλὴφιιι. According to the ordinary account, which
is that adopted by Bacon, they recognised only one certain proposition,
namely‚ that nothing can be known with certainty. lt was this dogmatic
scepticism (‘ Nova Academia acatalepsiam dogmatizavit et ex professo
tenuit' Aph. 67) which, as is generally supposed, distinguished this school
srom the Pyrrhonists, Ephectici, or Sceptics proper. The latter school
endeavoured to maintain arr ίταχὴ (suspension of judgrnent) between the
affirmation and negation of propositions‚ saying that it is impossible to
know whether we know snything or not. The ἀταραξία (or imperturb-
ablencss of mind) which the realisation oi this uncertainty produces is
the supreme end of philosophy.

Ueberweg‚ however, questions the accuracy os the popular distinction
between the New Academy and the Sceptics. He regards, indeed, the
scepticism of the tormer as the less thorough·going ol the two, but not
lor the reason ordinarily assigned The philosophers of the New Academy,
he supposes, differed, in general, from the Sceptics, in not making ἀταραξία
the supreme end of philosophy, and, furthermore, in admitting a theory
of probability, which served as a practical guide oi liie.

This theory ol probability recognises three grades. They are derived
respectively from (ι) φαντασία πιθανή, our first impression of an object;
(2) φαντασία πιθανὴ ἅμα καὶ ἀπαρισταστόι, the concurrent testimony of our
various impressions; (3) φαντασία ἀπερισπαστὸς καί διεξωδιυμένη, the same
concurrent testimony, when thoroughly siited and examined by the reason.
The highest degree oi probability takes the place of certainty in other
systems. Bacon alludes to the Academic theory oi probability in Aph. 67.

⁴² lt will be noticed that Bacon opposes to the ‘nihil scin' posse’ os
tlre New Academy ‘non multum sciri posse‚' that he interpolates ‘in
natura,' and to ‘simpliciter' opposes ‘ea, quae nunc in usu est, via' ‘ln
