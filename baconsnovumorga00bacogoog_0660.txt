videtur: unde quis facile in errorem labatur, si existimet toto
illo tempore sonum tanquam natare et haerere in aere3 quod
falsissimum est. Etenim illa resonatio non est idem sonus
numero, sed renovatur. Hoc autern manifestatur ex seda·
tione sive cohibitione corporis percussi. Si enim sistatur et
detineatur campana fortiter et fiat immobilis, statim perit
sonus nec resonat amplius3 ut in chordis, si post primam
percussionem tangatur chorda, vel digito utin lyra, vel calamo
ut in espinetis‚ statim desinit resonatio. Magnete autern
remote, statim ferrum decidit. Luna autern a mari non potest
removeri; nec terra a ponderoso dum cadit ⁴⁶. Itaque de illis
nullum fieri potest experimentum sed ratio eadem est.

(14) Sit Motus Decimus Quartus, Motus configurationes,
aut Situs⁴⁷,· per quern corpora appetere videntur, non coi-
tionem aut separationem aliquam, sed situm, et collocationem,
et configreratrbnem curn aliis. Est autern iste motus valde
abstrusus, nec bene inquisitus. Atque in quibusdam videtur
quasi incausabilis3 licet revera (ut existimamus) non ita sit.
Etenim si quaeratur cur potius coelum volvatur ab oriente in
occidentem quam ab occidente in orientem⁴⁸ 3 aut cur vertatur

⁴⁶ Note that here, as in ii. 45 and elsewhere, Bacon connects the fall of
heavy bodies to the earth and the phenomena of the spring and neap tides
with magnetic attraction.

⁴⁷ This ‘motus’ may be illustrated by the form of crystals, or the
cellular structure of animals and plants, or the tendency of each particular
species to assume a definite shape 1 cannot agree with Dr. Hippus that
there is anything strange in referring to this head the directions of the
celestial motions or the polarity of the magnerio needle.

⁴³ Or, as we should put it, why the earth rotates from west to east.
This direction of motion, whether orbital or axial, as we have already seen
(see ii. 36 (2) with note 98), is common to all the planets and their satel-
lites, with the sole known exception of the satellites of Uranus. Moreover,
the sun itself rotates on its axis in the same direction. F or Laplace's cal-
culations, by which he showed the enormously preponderating probability
of some common cause for this uniformity of direction, see Jevons' Prin·
ciples of Science, vol. i. pp. 287-9, and the works, on both sides of the
question, there referred to. This cause is, in all probability, connected
with the circumstances of the detachment of the planete or satellites from
the central mass of which they are supposed, according to the nebular
hypothesis, to have originally formed a part. For this ingenious theory
end for the earlier one of Bufion, which had forits obJect the explanation
