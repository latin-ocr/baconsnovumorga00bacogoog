ad omnes scientias pertinet3 ita et nostra, quae procedit per
inductionem, omnia complectitur. Tam enim historiam et
tabulas ⁶² inveniendi conficimus de ira, metu, et verecundia, et
similibus3 ac etiam de exemplis rerum civilium: nec minus
de motibus mentalibus memoriae, compositionis et divisionis ⁸³,
judicii, et reliquorum, quam de calido et frigido, aut luce, aut
vegetatione, aut similibus. Sed tamen cum nostra ratio in-

terpretandi, post historiam praeparatam et ordinatam, non
mentis tantum motus et discursus (ut logica vulgaris), sed et
rerum naturam intueatur3 ita mentem regimus, ut ad rerum
naturam se, aptis per omnia modis, applicare possit ⁶⁴. Atque
propterea multa et diversa in doctrina interpretationis prae·

For an analysis oi the historical method, he may consult the Editor’s
Inductive Logic, eth ed., pp. 201-203‚ and Mill's Logic, bk. vi. ch. ιο.
The whole ol the sixth book oi Mr. Mill's Logic bears on the methods oi
the moral and mental seiences.

Τὴε word ‘logicis’ in the above sentence should probably be taken as
including what we call ‘psychology’ as well as logie proper. But even
logie, in the strictest sense oi the term, rests ultimately on an inductive
basis. lt is only through having observed what proeesses of reasoning lead
to a sound, and what to an unsound conclusion, that is, to a conclusion
agreeing or disagreeing with facts, that men have been ableto irame with
any certainty even the rules ol logie itself.

‘² See last note.

‘⁸ Affinnation and Negation, not, as Mr. Ellis suggests, Synthesis and
Analysis. See Aldrich's Logic, ad init: ‘Est enimJudicium aliud Affirma-
tt'vum, quod vocatur etiam compostum aliud Negatt'vum, quod et Divisio!
This terminology is derived from Aristotle. Cp, for instance, De Inter-
pretatione, ch. i: περὶγὰρ σύνθεσιν troi δισίρεσίν ἔστιτὸ decidisse nni ed
ἀληθές. eb pin οὖν ὀνόματα αὐτὰ eol ed ῥήματα ἔοικε τῷ tivev συνθέσεως eol
διαιρέσεως νοήματι, οἶον ed ὅνθρωσοςῆ τὸ λευκόν, ὅταν pt) προστεθῇ τι· οὔτε
γὰρ ψεῦδος οὔτε ἀληθές πω.

⁰⁴ The object of this remark is to distinguish his own irom the vulgar
logie. The common logie is concemed only with the operations oi the
mind, regarded in and ior themselves, but the Baconian logie has forits
aim to interpret the ways oi external nature as well as the processes oi
the human mind, and hence it must adapt and accommodate itseli to
the quality and condition oi the various objects which it investigates.
This is a iar-seeing description ol the office and peculiarities oi the Induc-
tive Logic. Thus, ior example, one method or combination oi methods is
applicable to mechanica] problems, another to the problems oi chemistry,
athird to those oi physiology, and so on. Bacon’s own ‘Praerogativae
lnstantiarum' in the and Book would afford a good instance ot' what he
means.
