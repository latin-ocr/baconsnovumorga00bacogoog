RELATION OF NEWTON TO BACON. 125

a deep impression upon him and had, in great measure, suggested
to him the aims and methods of his own investigations ⁴⁸.

How then are we to account for his silence, as respects the name
and writings of Bacon? ln the first place, 1 think that the reputation
01 Bacon, as a reformer of scientific method, had now become so well
established a fact, and the leading principles 01 his philosophy so well
known, that explicit reference to him was superfluous. Those who
were constantly engaged in the pursuit of experimental philosophy
now no more thought of referring to Bacon asan authority for the
general principles on which they proceeded‚ than those engaged
in the disputes of the schools thought of referring explicitlyto 1110
worlrs of Aristotle or their manuals 01 logie. And yet, in each case,
they would have been perfectly ready to acknowledge the extent of
their obligation, if any doubt had been cast upon it.

ln the second place, I must recall to the mind of the reader what
1 have already more than once had occasion to mention, namely, the
comparative rarity 01 references to contemporary or recent writers
amongst the authors of the period 01 which I am treating. Thus,

we have seen that Locke, though, as I conceive and as is generally
supposed, owing the method and even the leading ideas 01 his

philosophy to Bacon, never mentions him by name or makes any
direct allusion to his writings. Galileo, as I have already remarked‚
was, I believe, equally silent. But, then, Galileo made no mention
of some of the most important discoveries 01 Kepler, even when 11
1ογ 10 1110 way to do so ⁴¹. Again‚ Kepler is never mentioned by
Descartes, and ‘in treating of the rainbow,' says Professor Playfair ⁴⁸,
‘Descartes bas made no mention of Antonio de Dominis.¹ 1 cannot
believe that, in all these cases, the silence is due to either contempt
or vanity or dishonesty, though, then as now, any of these motives

01 1100101 Kuowledge (pt. 1. p. 10), adoptinga remark 01 Dugald Stewart (Elements,
Ed. 1100111100, vol. ii. p. 236), adduces Newton's applicatiou 01 the word ⁴ axiom'
to the Laws 01 Μο1100 and the higher generalisations of Optics, as a proof
01 1110 1011000110 exercised on him by Bacon's logical phraseology. This argument
may have some weigbt, 110100 1 shall point 001 10 a note 00 Bk. i. Aph. 7, Newton
does 001 use the word ‘axiom’ with 00 much latitude as does Bacon, and, more·
orer. 10 the 10000010 01 logio which he probably read as a young man, 00 far from
finding the word restricted, as at present, 10 sels-evident propositious in mathe-
marles, he would find it used as the equivalent 01 Proposition in general.
