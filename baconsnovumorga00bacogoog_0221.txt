·Nec manus nuda, nec intellectus sibi permissus, multum
valet; instrumentis et auxiliis res perficitur3 quibus opus
est, non minus ad intellectum, quam ad manum. Atque ut
instrumenta manus motum aut cient aut regunt3 itaet in-
strumenta mentis intellectui aut suggerunt aut cavent.

[carl sowing„ Scientia et potentia humana in idem coincidunt ², quia
ignoratio causae destituit effectum. Natura emm non nisi

parendo vincitur³: et quod in contemplatione instar causae
est, id in operatione instar regulae est.

Ad opera nil aliud potest homo, quam ut corpora natu·
ralia admoveat et amoveat: reliqua natura intus transigit ⁴.

nec amplius scit, aut potest. Neque enim ullae vires causarum catenam
solvere aut perfringere possint, neque natura aliter quarn parendo vincitur!

Mr. Bywater has pointed out to me a passage in Galen (ed. Kiihn.
Tom. xv. p. 309) shewing that the expression ‘minister naturae’ was used
by Hippocrates, who called the true physician nir φύσεως ὑπηρέτην.

² The same thought is often briefly expressed in English under the
form: ‘Knowledge is Power.’ (Cp. Hobbes, De Homine, cap. x':
‘Scientia potentia est, sed parva; quia scientia egregia rara est, nec
proinde apparens nisi paucissimis, et in paucis rebus.’) It may be re·
marked that Power always implies Knowledge, but Knowledge does not
always give power. To do a thing, we must know how to do it, but there
are some departments oi knowledge which, however interesting in thern-
selves or valuable as instrumente of mental discipline, do not appear to
increase our power over Nature.

Bacon seldom loses any opportunity oi insisting on the practical ap-
plications oi science. Professor Playiair truly remarks that the want os
connexion between the sciences and arts wasone os the principal desects
which Bacon deplored in the philosophy oi his time.

³ We must patiently observe Nature, if we wish to acquire any control
over her operatione. Our ‘rules’ are merely copies and adaptations os
the ‘causes’ which we see at work in the external world. The same
sentence, slightly altered, is repeated in Aphorism 129. See note on it in
that place.

⁴ We cannot create; we can only combine or separate bodies already
existing. ‘In Art,' says Playfair, ‘man does nothing more than bring
things nearer to one another, or carry them farther off3 the rest is
performed by Nature, and on most occasions by means of which we are
quite ignorant!
