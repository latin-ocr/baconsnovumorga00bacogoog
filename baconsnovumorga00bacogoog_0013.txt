viii PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITJON.

Oxford Edition ⁰f. 1813), though Ι have introduced

many alterations and additions. With the Index to
the Text! is incorporated the Index to the Notes.
This is, sor the most part, in English, as the other
is, ior the most part, in Latin. The admixture os
English and Latin in the same Index presents, it
must be consessed, a somewhat motley appearance,
but Ι trust that this defect will be more than out·
weighed by the lacility for reference which is allorded
by such an arrangement. When a word occurs in
the Notes only, it is printed in Italics ; when it occurs
in the Text only, or both in the Text and the Notes‚
it is printed in the ordinary Roman type.

1 have thought it desirable to draw up a separate
Index to the Introduction.

lt only remains to express my obligations to
previous writers on the same subject, and to the
friends who have assisted me in my work. Ι have
read, or, at least, consulted all the annotated editions
ol the Novum Organum and all the dissertations on
Bacon’s Logic or Philosophy, to which 1 have been
able to obtain access. To these works Ι have,
wherever there was occasion, expressed my obligations
but 1 must here specially select, lor more particular
acknowledgment, the magnificent Edition of Bacon's
Works by Ellis and Spedding, the French Edition
by M. Bouillet, the Edition os the Novum Organum
by ΜΓ. Kitchin (whose generosity in allowing me
to replace it by the present edition demands my
special thanks), the works on Bacon's Philosophy
