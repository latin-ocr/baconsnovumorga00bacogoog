nisi terminentur ⁷⁰ in materia et fabrica secundum veras lineas,
speculativa sunt, et minus utilia. Interim sufficient et boni

Etenim ex his quos proposuimus motibus alii prorsus sunt
invincibiles ; alii aliis sunt fortiores, et illos ligant, fraenant,
disponunt; alii aliis longius jaculantur; alii alios tempore et
celeritate praevertunt3 alii alios fovent, roborant, ampliant,
accelerant.

Motus antitypiae omnino est adamantinus et invincibilis.
Utrum vero Motus nexus sit invincibilis adhuc haeremus.

'⁰ Be ‘defined' or ‘limited'

'¹ ln ii. 8, Bacon absolutely denies the existence oi a vacuum. See note
on that passage and also note 59 on the ‘Motus Secundus? ln the latter
note, l have referred to Bacon’s change oi opinion on the subjectos
a vacuum, and have quoted a ‘ Canon’ irom the Historia Densi et Rari
(which work, or, at least, the latter part oi it, was written during his
last ‘quinquennium '), where he says: ‘Non est vacuum in natura, nec
congregatum nec intermistum! See E. and S.,vol. ii. p. 303. Taking
that as his last utterance on the subject, and bearing in mind the positive
manner in which he speaks in ii. 8, as also the apparent bias os i. 66 and
ii. 48 (2), we must,l think, notwithstanding the expressions of doubt in
the present passage, regard him as having deliberately rejected the doctrine
of avacuum.

²² 1 borrow the following note srom Ellis and Spedding's Edition:
“¹Vacuum permistum,'’ κενὸν ἀχώριστον, is vacuum diffused through the
interstices oi any portion oi matter. By “vacuum coacervatum,” κενὸν
κεχωρισμένον, is meant clear empty space. See, ior this distinction,
Aristotle, Phys. iv. 7 [p. 214]. Hero of Alexandria, whom Bacon mentions
more than once, approves oi those who admit the former kind oi vacuum
and reject the latter. See the Introduction to his Spiritalia.

‘[1t is perhaps worth observing that in the iable entitled “Cupido sive
Atomus ” (De Sap. Vet. xvii), where the theory oi a vacuum is mentioned,
this distinction was not introduced till Bacon revised the work in his later
years The passage which stands thus in the original edition (1609)-
“Quisquis autem atomum ponit et vacuum, necessario virtutem atomi ad
