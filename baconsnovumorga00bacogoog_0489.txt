aliquod jampridem explosum est3 non tantum quia ratio
ejus non est probabilis, sed propter experientiam manifestam
discursus et irregularis motus cometarum per varia loca coeli.
· Αι rursus alia instantia sordens circa hoc subjectum est
motus aeris; qui intra tropicos (ubi circuli rotationis sunt
majores) videtur et ipse rotare ab oriente in occiden-
tem ⁵⁰.

Et alia rursus instantia soret fluxus et refluxus maris, si
modo aquae ipsae deprehendantur ferri motu rotationis (licet
tardo et evanido) ab oriente in occidentem; ita tamen ut
bis in die repercutiantur ⁵⁷. Itaque, si haec ita se habeant,

comets generally, as well as the opinions of previous philosophos, see
Meteorol. i. 6, 7.

⁶⁶ Bacon is alluding to the Trade-Winds, which, when not interfered
with by local causes, blow, speaking roughly, irom east to west. On the
causes os these vinds, see Herschel's Outlines ol Astronomy, loth Ed,
ᾧ 239, dre, or Tyndall’s Heat a Mode oi Motion‚ ξ 206, διο. (3rd Ed), or
almost any manual ot' Physical Geography.

The ‘circuli rotationis,' of which Bacon speaks, must be those of the
winds, or oi the heavens; ior, in the Tractate de Fluxu et Refluxu Maris
(E. and S.‚ vol. iii. p. 5 3), he speaks ol the theory of the earth's rotation as
‘satis licenter excogitatum, quoad rationes physicas‚' language which is in
accordance with what he invariably says elsewhere, when the question is
definitely beiore him. See Introduction, pp. 34-37, and my notes there
referred to.

⁶¹ Bacon does not seem to have suspected the true theory oi the semi·
diumal tides, namely, that they are caused by the combined, or some·
times opposed, attractione oi the sun and moon, heaping up, as it were,
the waters nearest to thern, as well as those most remote lrom them.
The foundations oi this theory were first laid in calculation by Newtou,
though the influence ol the sun and moon, or oi the sun or moon, on the
tides had osten been previously suggested, in a more or less vague way.
Bacon's own theory seems ιο have been that the waters, under the in·
fluence of the sun, move naturally from east to west, but that they are
driven back by striking on the coasts oi America. See his Tractate de
F luxu et Refluxu Maris, and the Introduction to it by Mr. Ellis (E. and S,
