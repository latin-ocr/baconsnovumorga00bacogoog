invariably connected, there is nothing to determine which is the
Form of the other, except the somewhat vague statement that one,
besides being convertible with the other, is a limitation of some
‘more general nature :’ ‘inveniatur natura alia, quae sit cum natura
data convertibilis, et tamen sit limitatio naturae notioris, instar
generis veri ⁴⁸3 It might, however, be asked, how are we to ascer-
tain the genus of which the Form is the limitation and the ‘natura
data' the species? How, lor instance, are we to know that heat is
aspecies of motion, rather than motion a species of heat? And
still, before we begin to search lor the differentia, this preliminary
point must be settled. The best solution, it appears to me, of this
difficulty is to suppose that Bacon was thinking quite as much of
the relation of cause and effect as ol that of genus and species, and
that the subsequence in thought of the ‘limitation' (constituting the
specieslto the genus which it qualifies should be translated, in order
to express his meaning fully, into the subsequence in time of the
effect to the cause. The question which of two natures is cause, and
which effect, can, of course, always be determined in any individual
instance, if we can ascertain which of the two has preceded the
other.

A third remark is one which I have frequently had occasion to
make in the notes on the early Aphorisms ol the Second Book,
namely, that the whole ol the enquiry into Form, and, consequently,
the Method of Exclusions, proceeds on the assumption that every
phenomenon has only one cause, that is to say, is due to only one
set of conditions. Ol the ‘simple natures’ there is some one, and
one only, which, if it could be found, is the ‘Form' of the ‘natura
data’ ‘Tum vero post rejectionem et exclusivum debitis modis
factam, secundo loco *¹⁸²* manebit *¹³* fomra affirmativa! But
· the same event, as is so often and so justly insisted on by Mr. Mill,
whenever he has occasion to spealr of what he terms ‘Plurality of
Causes,’ may be due to one set of conditions at one time and toa
different set of conditions at another. (On Bacon’s neglect of this
consideration, see Mill’s Logic, bk. v. ch. 3. ξ 7.) Hence, though it
is invariably true that the same cause is always followed by the same
effect, the converse proposition that the same effect is always due to
the same cause would frequently be misleading. Of Bacon's criteria
of a Form, therefore, as well as of the exclusion ola Form, some, as
