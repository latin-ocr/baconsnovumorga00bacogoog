sed cum analogia ²⁷, qualis competit sensui. Nunc vero ad

Post Tabulas conparentiae primae et rq'ectionem sive ex· '
clusinam, nec non vindemiationem primam factam secundum
eas, pergendum est ad reliqua auxilia intellectus circa inter·
pretationem naturae et inductionem veram ac perfectam. In
quibus proponendis, ubi opus erit tabulis, procedemus super
calidum et frigidum; ubi autem opus erit tantum exemplis
paucioribus, procedemus per alia omnia: ut nec confundatur

' inquisitio, et tamen doctrina versetur minus in anguste.

Dicemus itaque primo loco, de Praerogativulnstantiarumu:

¹⁷ By this explanation he means that the ‘calidum ad sensum’ is simply
the ‘calidum in se' in its relatibn to our senses. ‘Calon’ as perceived by
us, is modified by the condition of the percipient

²³ Mr. Ellis (pp. 266, 267) has an interesting note on various points
connected with the ‘Inquisitio de forma calidi.³ lt is too long to quote,
but the student may referto it with advantage, bearing in mind, however,
that the dynamical theory of heat has gained considerably iu evidence
since the time at which Mr. Ellis wrote. Most of the points touched on in
this note have been mentioned by me in the course of my own annotatione.

The ‘ulteriora armilia’ are designed for the purpose of persecting the
‘Exclusiva,' for which purpose the Tables alone are not supposed to be
sufficient The necessary imperfectiori of his method, in the present state
of knowledge, and with the present modes of enquiry, is acknowledged
by Bacon himself in Aph. 19.

To the parenthetical character of the Apborism just concluded 1 have
already drawn attention in the extracts from Mr. Ellis’ General Preface
in note 96 above.

¹⁹ So called from the ‘Tribus Praerogativa’ which, being selected by
lot, voted first in the ⁴ Comitia Tributa ² of the Romans, and thus afforded
an indication of the mode in which the other tribes were likely to vote.
lts vote also frequently exercised a considerable influenee on the succeeds
ing votes.

‘By the prerogatives of instantes,' says Sir John Herscbel (Discourse on
the Study of Natural Philosophy, § 190), ‘Bacon understands characteristic
phenomena, selected from the great miscellaneous mass of facts which
occur in nature, and which, by their number, indistinctness, and com·
plication, tend rather to confuse than to direct the mind in its search
for causes and general heads of induction. Pheoomena so selected on
account of some peculiarly forcible way in which they strilre the reason,
