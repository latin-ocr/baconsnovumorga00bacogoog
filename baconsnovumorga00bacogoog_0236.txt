Anticipationes satis firmae suut ad consensum; quandoqui-

formiter, illi satis bene inter se congruere possent ³⁵.

,⁸⁶ Uniformity of opinion, even if it extend to universal consent, is no
evidence of truth.

All men alike might be mad, and there might beno one to observe
or point out the fact of their madness. Similar suppositions as to the
possibility of the universality ol error are constantly started by Descartes,
andare resolved, in his philosophy, by the consideration of the veracity
of God, who would never have so formed his creatures as to be exposed
to the risk of insuperable deception.

Though this Aphorism is stated in au extravagant form, it suggests two
very important considerations: (1) the relativity of human knowledge3
(2) the possibility oi universal error.

With reference to the first, the student may consult, amongst recent
writings, Sir W. Hamilton's Essay on the Philosophy of the Unconditioned
(published in the ‘Discussions’), his lectures on Metaphysics, Lects.
viii, ix, Mill's Examination of Hamilton, chs. 2, 3, 4, and Grote's Plato,
ch. 26 (rst ed, vol. ii. pp. 322-363). l shall limit myself to a few
remarks, ditectly suggested by Bacon’s supposition. All truth must
be relative to ourselves, that is to the special constitution of the human
faculties. We cannot transcend human consciousuess. We cannot do
more than observe phenomena and reflect on the observatione made. All
that we know, we can know only through the medium of our own senses
and our own intellect, and hence all knowledge must be relatr'm to our
own cognitive powers. All that we ean say, in the last resort, is that a
proposition is true to us. As to what may be true or false to other orders
of beings, differently constituted, we can have no conception, except so
far as we have grounds for supposing that their intelligences and the con·
ditions under which their intelligences work are analogous to our own.
As to ‘absolute truth,’ or ‘truth in itself,' the phrase seems to be entirely
devoid oi meaning, the very word ‘truth ' implying a percipient or thinking
subject as well as an object of perception or thought. Thus, it is quite
conceivable that beings with different faculties, or brought up amidst a
different set oi conditions, might, if they could observe us, suppose us
to be all mad after the same fashion, as we, similarly, should suppose
them to be.

As regards the second consideration, namely, the possibility of universal
error, an important distinction must be drawn. Our immediate perceptions
(when corrected by comparison with each other and with those ol other
men) are our ultimate test of tnrth3 if these deceive us, we have no
other criterion to guide us. But our inserences from these perceptions
not only may be, but frequently are, false, and it has sometimes happened,
as in the belief that the earth was the centte of the solat system, that
all mankind have through several generations been mistakeu in the in-
