mensuris tempomm simplicibus haec dicta sint.

Verum non solum quaerenda est mensura motuum et actio-
num simpliciter, sed multo magis comparative: id enim exitas
est usus, ct ad plurima spectat. Atque videmus flammam al]-
cujus tormenti ignei citius cerni, quam sonitus audiatur; licet

necesse sit pilam prius aerem percutere, quam flamma quac
pone erat exire potuerit; fieri hoc autem propter velociorem
transactionem motus lucis,quam soni. Videmus etiam species
visibiles a visu citius excipi quam dimitti 39; unde fit quod
nervi fidium, digito impulsi, duplicentur aut triplicentur quoad ,
speciem, quia species nova recipitur, antequam prior demit· ²

et sax ardens, noctu velociter portata, conspiciatur caudata
Etiam ex hoc fundamento inaequalitatis motuum quoad
velocitatem, excogitavit Galilaeus⁴¹ causam fluxus et refluxus

⁸⁸ l think that Bacon must herc have in mind cosmical clouds, iu tbc
interstellar spaces‚ not ordinary or aerial clouds. The argument is thar
the light ol the stars, il it took a long time lor its transmission, would be
frequently stopped by various obstacles in the sky, whereas, on a clear
night, we invariably see the stars where we expect to find them. At the
same time, it must be conlessed that, is there were such obstacles as l am
supposing Bacon to contemplate, the light might sometimes be interoepted
however instantaneous its transmission. There is, then, an undoubted
difficulty in the passage, though it does not appear to me so great as it
seems to appear to hlr. Spedding.

³⁹ The retention ol images on the retina ol the eye is a familiar pheno
menon, ol which the readerwill easily supply himself with instantes The
duration ol the persistence varies with the intensity ol the light and the
sensitiveness of the organ. ‘M. Plateau has investigated the duration ol
the impression by numerous methods, and has lound that itis on the
average half a second. ι ⁴ ι Α great number ol pieces os apparatus are
founded on the persistence ol sensation on the retina. Such are the
thaumatropc‚ the phenakistoscope, F araday's wheel, the kaleidophone,
and the zoetrope.’ Ganot’s Physics, 12th Ed, ξ 625.

‘⁰ Mr. Ellis says that ‘ in the case ol vibrating strings Bacon's explana-
tion is not altogether complete. The distinct or quasidistinct images to
which he refers correspond to limiting positione ol the vibrating string.’

⁴² ‘This account ol Galileo’s theory ol the tides is inaccurate ln this
theory the tides are caused by the varying velocity ol different points ol
the earth's suriace, arising lrom the composition ol the earth's two
motions, namely that about its axis, and that in its orbit Bacon does not
seem to have perceived that both these motions are essentia} to the
