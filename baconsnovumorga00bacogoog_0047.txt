18 INTRODUCTION.

videtur) adhuc repertum est' The faculties of Memory, Imagin-
ation‚ and Reason are made the basis of the general divisions of
Learning into History‚ Poetry, and Philosophy. ‘Intellectus’ or
Understanding seems to' be the generie term including Memory,
Imagination, and Reason²³. As distinct from the ‘Doctrina de
Anima’ (or, as we should now say, Psychology), there are two arts
which treat of the use and objects of the mental faculties. These
are Logic and Ethic. ‘Logica de intellectu et Ratione; Ethica
de Voluntate, Appetitu‚ et Affectibus disserit: altera Decreta, altera
Actiones progignit! Imagination exercises the functions of a mes·
senger or intermediary in both departments‚ that of Reason and that
of Will. ‘Nam Sensus idola omnigena Phantasiae tradit, de quibus
postea Ratio judicat: at Ratio vicissim idola electa et probata
Phantasiae transmittit, priusquam hat executio decreti ⁹⁶!

It may be noticed that the sharp line of demarcation drawn here
and in similar passages between the offices of the so-called ‘faculties’
was a common feature of the philosophy of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centurias, and has only been replaced in comparatively
recent times by a more just appreciation of the complexity of our
various mental operations and of the number of elements which go
to make up some even of those psychical acts which at first sight
appear the simplest.

Passing over the very curious remarks which Bacon makes on
‘Natural Divination’ and ‘F ascination' (the two ‘appendices’ as he
calls thern, to the part ‘De F acuitatibus Animae), 1 may direct special
attention to the distinction which he draws between Perception and
Sense, a distinction which he notes as deficient ‘in this doctrine!
This distinction is not the same as that drawn by later philosophers
between Perception and Sensation¹⁷‚ but corresponds rather with that

²⁵ See Adrancement of Learning. bk. ii. (E. and S., vol. iii. p. 329): ‘The parts
of human learning have reference to the three parts of Man's Understauding, which
is the seat of learning: History to his Memory, Poesy to his Imagination, and
Philosophy to his Reasom' ln the corresponding part of the De Augmentis (lib.
ii. cap. ι), the word ‘Understanding’ is replaced by ‘Anima Rationalis’ But,
almost immediately afterwards, ‘Intellectus' or Understanding seems to be used ns
a generic term. For sense is called the ‘door of the understanding' (intellectus
janua), aud then the intellecturi processes which follow on the impressions of sense
are enumerated ss Memory, imagination, and Reason. I do not know of any pas·
sege in Bacon’s works, where ‘intellectus’ or understanding is employed in the
specifie sense appropriated to νοῦς by Plato and Aristode, as the faculty which
apprehends the first principles of knowledge.
