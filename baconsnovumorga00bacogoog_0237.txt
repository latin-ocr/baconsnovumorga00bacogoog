208 NOVUM ORGANUM.

XXVIII.

Quin longe validiores sunt ad subeundum assensum antici-
pationes, quam interpretationem· quia ex paucis collectae,
iisque maxime quae familiariter occurrunt, Intellectum statim
perstringunt, et phantasiam implent; ubi contra, interpreta-
tiones, ex rebus admodum variis et multum distantibus spar-
sim collectae, intellectum subito percutere non possunt3 ut
necesse sit eas, quoad opiniones ³⁶, duras et absonas, lere instar
mysteriorum fidei, videri.

XXIX.

In scientiis, quae in opinionibus et placitis fundatae sunt,
bonus est usus arataeipationum et dialecticae; quando opus est
assensum subjugare, non res ³⁷.

XXX.

Non, si omnia omnium aetatum ingenia coierint, et labores
contulerint et transmiserint, progressus magnus lieri poterit in

ierences they drew from observed facts. ln such cases, the false inference
has olten, in the first instance, been drawn by one or a few persons, and
the rest have accepted it implicitly on their authority. Errors oi this
kind, however long or universally they may have obtained, need not lead
us to despair as to the possibility oi attainIng truth. Previous errors
in reasoning have been detected by the employment oi the reasoning
process itsell', and hence we may fairly suppose that, if there are any
questions now on which all men are mistalren, posterity will be able to
correct our salse inlerenccS, as we have corrected those of our ancestors.
The source of our errors itseli supplies us with the means of correcting
thern.

³⁸ ‘So far as concems the opinions which men have of them‚' ‘in
common estimation' Some oi the later editions omit the comma aster
opiniones, which makes the passage unintelligible.

³¹ If the allusion beto the moral and political sciences, the passage
must be ironIcal as, in Aph. 127, Bacon distinctly states that his method
is applicable to all sciences allice, and he particularly specifies logie,
ethics, and politics. We may, perhaps, represent his thought somewhat
as follows: ‘ln morals, politics, logie, 3ηά sciences oi that kind people
care so little iortruth 3ηά so much lor disputation and victory, that we may
leave them to their own method, till they have changed their aims and
point of view. 11 they wish lor truth in these subjects, they must conduct
their enquiries according to the new method, duly combining induction
with syllogism; but, if they only wish to find arguments lor pre-conceived
opinions, let them go on in the old iashion!
