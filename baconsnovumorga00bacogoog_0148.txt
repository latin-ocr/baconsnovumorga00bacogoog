INFLUENCE ΟΝ THE UNIVERSITIES. 119

Learning ‘in the universities here and the English colleges abroad,'
we have still sufficient evidence to shew that his works were producing
a real and perceptible influence.

The ready welcome accorded to the London savam in Oxford in
1648 and 1649 (see Wallis’s account), the fact that they were joined
by several Oxford men, and the uninterrupted meetings of the
incipient Royal Society in Oxford till the dispersion of several of its
members in 1658, would alone furnish satisfactory evidence of the
spread of the ‘New Philosophy’ in one, at least, of the Universities ³⁹.
But Bp. Sprat expressly tells us (p. 53) that, besides being ‘frequented
by some Gentlemen of Philosophical Minds‚ whom the misfortunes of
the Kingdom and the security and ease of a retirement amongst
Gown-men had drawn thither,' ‘the University had, at that time, many
members of its own, who had begun a free way of reasoning,' an
expression which undoubtedly denotes the baconian, as opposed to
the Aristotelian or traditional method. In describing their rneetings,

he proceeds: ‘By this means there was a race of young men pro
vided, against the next age, whose minds, receiving from them their

first impressions of sober and generous knowledge, were invincibly
armed against all the enchantments of Enthusiasm. But what is

more,I may venture to affirm that it was in good measure by the
intluence which these Gentlemen had over the rest, that the University
itself, or, at least, any partos its Disciplina and Order, was saved
from ruin.'

At a period a little later than the publication of Sprat's book,
Dr. Beal, writing to Boyle‚ Nov. 27, 1671, has a passage which will
be read with some interest by many Oxford men, and which, as I
have not seen it noticed before, I transcribe at length:

‘At my request a young Oxonian prepared me a list of lit, capable,
and hopeful persons, addicted to the design of the Royal Society, and
willing to entertain correspondencies, and to assist in them. They
seemed to me by their qualifications, and number, very considerable;
some in every college, and in every hall. Only in one college, there

'⁹ Αηά yet the Juniors do not seem, at any rate in some of the Colleges, to have
prolited much from this intellectual activity of their seniora. See Locke's account
of the ariri and unstimulating character of his studies during the earlier years of his
academical life, as given in bis confidenoes to Lady Maaham and le Clerc (Fon
Boume's Life of Locke, vol. i. pp. 47. 48). ln referring to Mr. Fox Boume's
worlr, 1 must not be supposed to endorse altogether bis account of the Oxford cur-
riculum at this time. much of which appears to me (as 1 have pointed out in my
own Life of Loclre, p. 7) to be an ideal construction. Locke, in later years, joined
the scientihc circle of which Boyle was the centre.
