pellare consuevimus. Eae sunt veluti oppositae instantiis
ostensivis. Exhibent enirn naturam inquisitam in infima vir·
tute, et tanquam in incunabulis et rudimentis suis; tentantem
et tanquam primo experientem, sed sub contraria natura
latentem et subactam. Sunt autern hujusmodi instantiae
magni omnino momenti ad inveniendas formas: quia sicut
ostensivas ducunt facile ad differentias, ita chaniestinaa ducunt
optime ad genera ⁶⁰3 id est, ad naturas illas communes,
quarum naturae inquisitae nihil aliud sunt quarn limitationes,

Exempli gratia3 sit natura inquisita Consistcns, sive se
determinans ; cujus contrarium est Liquidum, sive fluens ⁰¹.
Instantius clandestinae sunt illae quae exhibent gradum non·
nullum debilem et infimum consistentis in iluid03 veluti bulla
aquae, quae est tanquam pellicula quaedam consistens et
determinata, lacta ex corpore aquae. Similiter stillicidia,
quae, si adiuerit aqua quae succedat, producunt se in filum
admodum tenue, ne discontinueter aqua3 at si non detur
talis copia aquae quae succedere possit, cadit aqua in guttis
rotundis, quae est figura quae optime aquarn sustinet contra

cumstance of cohesion in this extreme case must have contributed largely
to forming just notions oi the nature and extent oi the property.

⁸⁰ These instances, being ou the extreme border, serve to detennine the
range oi the genus, as the ‘ glaring instances: exhibiting a property in its
most striking form, serve to direct attention to the most characteristic
features oi the phenomenon, or, in other words, its differentiae.

⁶¹ Bacon employs interchangeably the terms F luid and Liquid, which,
with us, stand respectively for the genus (including gases) and the species.
By ‘fluens’ he means a liquid. Gases are by him included under ‘corpora
pneumatica‚' as opposed to ‘corpora tangibilia¹ See Aph.40 and Historia
Densi et Rari.

⁶² The spheroidal shape is due to the cohesion oi the molecules oi the
water. ‘ln large masses oi liquids‚ the soree oi gravity overcomes that ol
cohesion. Hence liquids acted upon by the former soree have no special
shape3 they talre that oi the uessel in which they are contained But in
smaller masses cohesion gets the upper hand, and liquids present then the
spheroidal form. This is seeo in the drops oi dew on the leaves oi plants;
it is also seen when a liquid is placed on a solid which it does not moisten;
as, ior example, mercury upon wood. The experiment may also be made
with water, by sprinkling upon the suriace oi the wood some light powder,
such as lycopodium or lampblack, and then dropping some water on it.’
