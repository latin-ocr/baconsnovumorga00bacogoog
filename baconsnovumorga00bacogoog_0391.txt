2. Radii solis reflexi et constipati, ut inter montes, aut per
parietes, et maxime omnium in speculis comburentibus.

tionately with the increase and diminution ol beat, that phenomenon
would be the cause or the effect ol heat, or, at least, connected with it
through some lact ol causation, and the conditions would thus conform
to the requirements ol the Method ol Concomitant Variations. ll it
could be shewn that this phenomenon and heat were the only circum·
stances which varied concurrently, then the phenomenon would be proved
to be either the cause or the effect ol heat, and would conform to the
requirements ol the rider to this last Method’ (given in Inductive Logic‚
p. 183l.

‘The “ Exemplum exclusivae, sive rejectionis naturarum a forma calidi,’'
(which is based on the three loregoing Tables) bears some, though, it
must be aclmowledged, a very slight, resemblance to the Method of
Residues. These “rejectiones '' conslst in excluding some possible ex·
planation ol the phenomenon, either because an instance, which does
not present the phenomenon, does present the assigned cause, or because
an instance, which does present the phenomenon, does not present the
assigned cause (and similarly with regard to increase and decrease). As
an instance ol the former, we may take the following “rejectio ”: “ Per
radios lunae (which were then supposed to be cold) et aliarum stellarum
rejice lucem et lumen.” As instances ol the latter, we may talre the two
following: “Per radios solis, rejice naturam elementarem (that is, “ ter·
restrial nature,'’ which is composed ol “the four elemeuts ’'); Per ignem
communem, et maxime per ignes subterraneos (qui remotissimi sunt, et
plurimum intercluduntur a radiis coelestibus) rejice naturam coelestem.''
By a successiou ol these “rejectiones'’ we limit the number ol possible
explanations, amongst which we are to look ior the true one. Bacon’s
“rejections,” however, not being, as a matter ol lact, exhaustive, lead to
a purely negative result; they may save us lrom unnecessary trouble in
seelring lor a cause where it cannot be found, but they do not, lilre the
Method ol Residues, leave a definite number ol antecedents which either
constitute the cause, or amongst which we lrnow that the cause is to be
sought.'

lt is plain that if there were a certain number only oi possible causes
ol the given phenomenon, and by the Method ol Rejections we could
exclude all but one, this one remaining cause would be the undoubted
cause ol the given phenomenon. This case Bacon appears to have
regarded as the perfect type ol Induction, and as alone capable oi alford-
ing certainty. For a criticism oi Bacon’s Method ol Rejections or
Exclusions, see Introduction, § 9.

ln comparing the logical procedure ol Bacon and Mill, it should be
careiully borne in mind that, whereas each ol Mr. llill’s Methods may be
worked independently, and lead to a final conclusion, Bacon contem·
plated the concurrent use of all the Tables as preparatory to his Method
ol Rejections, and regarded the construction ol the Tables and the sub·
