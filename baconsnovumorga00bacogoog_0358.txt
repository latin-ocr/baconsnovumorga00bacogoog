mines (id quod superius⁵³ dix-imus) quantum intersit inter
humanae mentis idola et divinae mentis ideas. Illa enim
nihil aliud sunt quam abstractiones' ad placitum: hae autem
sunt vera signacula Creatoris super creaturas, prout in materia
per lineas veras et exquisitas imprimuntur et terminantur.
Itaque ipsissimae res ⁶⁴ sunt (in hoc genere) veritas et utilitas:
atque opera ipsa pluris facienda sunt, quatenus sunt veritatis
pignora, quam propter vitae commoda ⁵⁵.

⁰⁸ Aph. 23.

⁶⁴ ‘Therefore, the very things themselves (that is, the facts of nature)
are, in this kind of enquiry, both truth and utility! He means that, if we
know the facts of nature, as they really are, we shall both attain truth and
gain rules for practice. Mr. Spedding thinks that, if this were the true
interpretation, we ought to have et before vm‘tas as well as before utilitas.
He proposes the translation ‘truth and utility are (in this kind) the very
same things,' though he acknowledges that this use of r'psrisimae cannot
be justified. To me there appears less difficulty in taking the passage asl
have done above. Mr. Ellis proposes to render it thus : ‘Truth and utility
are in this kind the very things we seelr for! Dr. Kitchin, to the same
effect, translates : ‘And so the chief things of all are, in this kind, Truth
and Usefulness.' This gives an excellent sense ; but will the words bear it?

⁵⁸ We have here an important modification of the point of view which is
prominent in Aph. 81. ‘Veritas et utilitas,’ and ‘veritas' rather than
‘utilitas' is, in this Aphorism, described as the proper andadequate object
of the Baconian method Cp. Aph. 129, where Bacon repeats, perhaps
still more unequivocally, the same sentiment.

The following passages, which are quoted by Mr. Spedding, appear to
me to be less in accordance with the spirit of this Aphorism than with that
of Aph. 81, which, it must be acknowledged, is, notwithstanding many
expressions to the contrary, representative of Baeon's general attitude on
this subject:

sunt; et quod in operando utilissimum, id in sciendo verissimum! Nov.

‘Si quis autem sit, cui in contemplationis amorem et venerationem

etenim in natura, opera non tantum vitae beneficia, sed et veritatis pignora
esse. Et quod in religione verissime requiritur, ut fidem quis ex operibus
monstret ; idem in naturali philosophia competere, ut scientia similiter ex
operibus monstretur. Veritatem enirn per operum indicationem, magis
quarn ex argumentatione aut etiarn ex sensu, et patelieri et probari.
