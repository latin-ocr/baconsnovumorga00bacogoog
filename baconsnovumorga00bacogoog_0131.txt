versity oi Oxiord¹⁸, &c.,‘as being liable to the objection that it is
merely complimentary or proceeds from persons who had themselves
no intimate acquaintance with science¹⁹‚ 1 proceed at once to cite
Descartes, himself an immediate successor of Bacon, and the ori·
ginator of a very different school of philosophy:

‘J’avois oublie alite un billet que je wiens de trouver en votre
lettre, oh vous me mandez avoir envoye ma lettre h M. Mydorga‚ et
que vous desirez savoir un moyen de faire des experiences utiles. h
cela Je n'ai rien h dire apres ce que Verulamius en a ecrit, sinon que,’ ’
&c Au. P. Mersenne²⁰, 1631 (OEuvres de Descartes, Ed. Cousin‚
vol. vi. p. 182).

'‘Vous m'avez autrefois mande que vous connoisiez des gens qui se
plaisoienthtravailler pour l'avancement des sciences, jusqueshvouloir
meme faire toutes sortes d’experiences a leurs depens: si quelqu’un
de cette humeur vouloit entreprendre d’ecrire l'histoire des apparences
celestes selon la methode de Verulamius, et que, sans y mettre au-
cunes raisons ni hypothese, il nous decrivit exactement le ciel tel qu'il
parolt maintenant, quelle situation a chaque etoile frxe au respect de
ses voisines * * * ⁸ ce seroit un ouvrage qui seroit plus utile au
public qu'il ne semble peute‘tre d’abord, et qui me soulageroit de
beaucoup de peine.² Id. 1632, p. 210. In another letter to P.

Mersenne (p. 93), Bacon is also mentioned.
These passages shew not only that Descartes entertained a great

Metropolis of the higher Austris. *¹ *¹ * * * There 1 found Kepler, a man famous
in the Sciences, as your Lordship knows, to whom I purpose to convey from hence
one of your Booka, that he may see we have some of our own that can honour our
King, as well as he hath done with his Harmonica'

lzaak Walton, ln his life of George Herbert, borrowing, apparently, the language
of Wotton, speaks of Bacon as ‘the great Secretary oi Nature and all learning,
Sir Francis Baeom'

¹⁸ leen ln Baceniana, pp. 204-206.

¹⁹ These objections, however, would hardly apply to the evidence which we
obtain incidentally frona a letter of Bacou himself to Andrewes (E. and S.‚ vol. vi.
p. 13), in which he says (in 1622) ε ‘I have received from many parts beyond the
seas testimonies touching that work [the N ovum organum} such as beyond which
1 could not expect at the first in so abstnrse an argument?

²⁰ Mersenne himself, in his work La verite des Sciences (published in 162 5), has
a special chapter on Bacon, in which he maintains against the sceptics that Baeon's
system is intended, not to destroy the authority of the senses and the reason, but to
discover means for arriviug at the knowledge of nature and its eliects. The Idols
are called the four bnttresses (arcs-houtans) of the Organon. Mersenne criticises
Bacon‘s attack on Aristotle, and makes several remarks on his individual experi-
ments, as well as on the theological opinions which are expressed in his works.
