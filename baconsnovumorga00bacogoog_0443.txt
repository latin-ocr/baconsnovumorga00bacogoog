and impress us with a kind of sense of causation or a particular aptitude
for generalisation, he considers, and justly, as holding a kind os prerogative
dignity, and claiming our first and especial attention in physical enquiries.’

On the more important of these ‘praerogativae instantiarum’ some ex·
cellent remarks and illustratione will be found in Herschel's Discourse,
dcc, §d 190-200, Playiair's Preliminary Dissertation to the Encyclopaedia
Britannica, Section 2, and Dr. Hippus' Account oi the Novum Organnm,
Part ii, in the Library oi Useiul Knowledge (which, however, borrows
largely from Playiair’s Dissertation). From these sources, 1 shall, as we
proceed‚ extract what appearslto me most valuable.

ln the ‘General Preface to the Philosophical Works,' Mr. Ellis remarks
that ‘to the word instance Bacon gives a wide range of signification. It
correspouds more nearly to cbsewatc‘on than to any other term which is
used in modern scientific language’

³⁰ Cp. the passage at the end oi the book: ‘ Nunc vero ad adnunciata
et rectificatibnes inductionis, et deinceps ad concreta, et latentes processio,
et latentes schematismos, et reliqua, quae aphorismo 21. ordine propn-
suimus, pergendum! In this passage ‘ad concreta’ seems to answer to
the ‘Variatio Inquisitionis pro Natura subjecti’ oi the text, and, perhaps,
‘Latentes Processus et Latentes Schematismi' to the ‘Deductio ad
Praxin,’ though M. Bouillet refers these also to the Variatio Inquisitionis.

Mr. Ellis (General Preface, p. 43) observes that the practical utility
oi the prerogative instances would have been explained when Eacon came
to speak oi the Adminicula Inductionis. M. Bouillet, on the other hand,
thinks that the ‘Adminiculs Inductionis ’ were to embrace the ‘ Minis-
tratio ad Sensum’ and ‘Ministratio ad Memoriam* mentioned in Aph.
10. He refers to the conclusion oi Aphs. 42 and 43, and quotes from the
Partis Secundae Delineatio the words ‘ministratio ad rationem cui minis·
trationes duae priores subministrant! See E. and S., vol. iii. p. 553.

ln M. Bouillet's note on this Aphon'sm, there is an attempt to determine
the exact character os these missing parts of the Novum Organum, and,
where possible, to supply thern from other portions oi Bacon's works.
The attempt is interesting and ingenious, but it is too conjectural‚ as well
as too lengthy‚ to admit of being reproduced here. The reader, however,
would do well to compare with this Aphorism the Partis Secundae De·
lineatio (E. and S·, vol. iii. pp. 547-57).

³¹ He seems here to contemplate the arrangement oi the simple natures,
or, at least, the principal ones, in a kind oi hierarchy, according to their
relative importatum, as in the sixth division he designs an exhaustive
enumeration oi them
