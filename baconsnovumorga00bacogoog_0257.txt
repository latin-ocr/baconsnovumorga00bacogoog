similiter: et tamen nisi duo ista, quae diximus, explorata
fuerint et in lucem producta, nihil magni fieri potest in
natura quoad opera. Rursus ipsa natura a'e'ris communis et
corporum omniurn, quae a'erem tenuitate superant (quae
plurima sunt), fere incognita est. Sensus enirn per se res
infirma est, et aberrans: neque organa ad amplificandos
sensus aut acuendos multum valent; sed omnis verior inter·
pretatio naturae conficitur per instantias, et experimenta
idonea et apposita; ubi sensus de experimento tantum, ex-
perimentum de natura et re ipsa judicat.

Intellectus humanus fertur ad abstracta propter naturam
propriam; atque ea, quae fluxa sunt, fingit esse constantia.
Melius autem est naturam secare, quam abstrahere ⁸⁵; id quod
Democriti schola fecit, quae magis penetravit in naturam,
quarn reliquae. Materia potius considerari debet, et ejus
schematismi, et meta-schematismi‚ atque actus purus ⁸⁶, et lex

internal process by which such change takes place is unknown to us, it
is called Latens Processus. (See Bk ii. Aphs 6, 7 ; and cp. ii. 48 ad fin,
where Bacon contests Democritus’ theory of the rigidity or unchangeability
of the atoms.)

⁸⁴ lt follows from Bacon's theory of tbe ultimate constitution of matter
that any alteration (ἀλλοίωσις) in a body is simply a motion amongst the
minute particles, a change in their arrangement, ‘latio per minima!

⁸⁶ lt is better to dissect nature by means of analysis, than to form
abstract theories about her, which bave no foundation in fact or esperi-
ment. The work of ‘abstraction‚’ that is of forming abstract or general
theories‚ is, of course, indispensable in the interpretation of nature, but it
ought to follow and not precede tbe work of ‘dissectiom’ that is, the
minute examination and interrogation of natural facts lt ison account
of its patience or supposed patience in tbe investigation of nature that
tbe school of Leucippus and Democritus seems to have been preferred by
flacon to the other schools of antiquity.

⁸⁶ This expression is the scholastic equivalent for the Aristotelian term
c'vae'pyrw or ἐντελέχεια as opposed to δύναμις, and, as such, may either mean
actual, as opposed to possible motion, growtb, or development, or actual, as
opposed to possible existence. For a δύναμις may either be a possibility of
motion (taking that word in the wide sense in which it is employed by
Aristotle), or a possibility of existence. lf it be a possibility of existence,
the existence itself, when realised‚ is called an ἐνέργεια or ἐντελέχεια. But,
