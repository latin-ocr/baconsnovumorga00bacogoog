⁵⁸ This conception of Weight is perfectly correct. Weight, which is the
amount of the earth’s attraction on a body, depends not on the consistency
of the body, but on the amount of matter contained in it. And, as the
amount of matter or mass depends partly on the volume and partly on the
density, two bodies of equal volume will vary in weight according to their
respective densities.

θ’ ‘Tm contrary of glaring are “clandestine instances,” where “the
nature sought is exhibited in its weakest and most imperfect state.” Of
this, Bacon himself has given an admirable example in the cohesion of
fluids,as a clandestine instance of the “nature or quality of consistence, or
solidity.” Yet here, again, the same acute discrimination which enabled
Bacon to perceive the analogy which connects fluids with solids, through
the common property of cohesive attraction‚ would, at the same time, have

enabled him to draw from it, if properly supported, every consequence ·

necessary to forming just notions of the cohesive force; nor does its
reference to the class of clandestine instances at all assist in bringing
forward and maturing the final results. When, however, the final result is
obtained‚—when our induction is complete, and we would verify it,-·this
class of instances is of great use, being, in fact, frequently no other than
that of extreme cares, such as we have already spoken of ; which, by
placing our conclusions, as it were, in violent circumstances, try their
temper, and bring their vigour to the test! Herschel's Discourse‚ § 193.

‘An example of this instance may be given from hydrostatics. lf the sus·
pension of water in capillary tubes be inquired into, it becomes very useful to
view that effect when it is least, or when the tube ceases to be capillary, and
becomes a vessel of a large diameter. The column is then reduced to a
slender ring of water, which goes all round the vessel; and this, though
now so inconsiderable, has the property of being independent of the siae
of the vessel, so as to be in all cases the same when the materials arethe
same. As there can be no doubt that this ring proceeds frorn the attrac-
tion of the sides, and of the part immediately above the water, so there can
beno doubt that the capillary suspension, in part at least, is derived from
the same cause. An effect of the opposite kind takes place when a glass
vessel is filled with mercury.' Playfair’s Preliminary Dissertation.

1 confess that, in the forrner quotation, 1 do not quite understand what
Sir John Herschel means by saying that ‘its reference to the class of
clandestine instances does not at all assist in bringing forward and
maturing the final results! The mere act of calling it a ‘clandestine
instance,' of course, does not; but, surely, the fact of noticing the cir·
