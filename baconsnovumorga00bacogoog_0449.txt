⁴⁴ ln this passage, Bacon seems explicitly to recognise what we call the
Plurality ot Causas, namely, the lact that an event may be due to various
causes or distinct sets os conditions An argument might henoe be deduoed
in favour of the position that by Fonnheinvariablyintends toexpress nature
or essence rather than cause. As l have stated, however, in the lntroduc·
tion,l believe that the word is employed by him in various shades ol
meaning in different places. Should it be said that the lorm is the set
ol conditions immediately preceding the phenomenon as it appears to us,
and that this is r'rrvon'ably the same, it must be borne in mind that, evenis
we granted this to be the case, the difficulty connected with Plurality
ol Causes would recur with regard to the set ol conditions immediately
preceding this, or the set immediately preceding that, and so on; so that it
would only be potsponed, not eliminated See my Inductive Logic, ath
ed„ vv· ¹25, 126, n· 4

⁴⁷ This explanation of the colour ol bodies is mere guess-worlr. We
have no sufficient evidence, at least as yet, lor determining the conditions
on whlch the absorption ol colours by various bodies depends. ln New-
ton's Optics, bk. ii. pt. iii, there is a curious and interesting attempt to
determine the same problem. Thus, lor instance, Newton thinlrs that ‘The
Bigness of the Component Parts ol Natural Bodies may be conjectured by
their colours 3' that ‘lor the productiori ol Black, the corpuscles must
be less than any of those which exhibit colours ;’ and that ‘microscopes
may at length be improved to the discovery ol the particles ol bodies
on which their colours depend, if they are not already in some measure
arrived to that degree ol perlection'

There is a long passage on the theory of Colours in Valerius Terminus
(E. and S, vol. iii. p. 236, lice). Notwithstanding much that is crude in
Bacon's speculations, we have only to compare them with such a book
as Telesius de Coloribus, to see on how much firmer ground the physicists
of bis age were treading than those of the previous generation.
