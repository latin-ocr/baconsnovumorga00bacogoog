ad init, I have spoken at such length on the history ol this dogma,
and the manner in which Bacon presents it in various parts of his
works, that it would be superfluous to say anything further on the
subject in this place. ’

That in the Sylva Sylvarum (on which, however, see the apologetlc
remarks ol Rawley in his preiace to the work ⁶¹) Bacon affords his coun-
tenance to many of the most absurd sancies os his time, isa fact so well
known and so universally coniessed that it hardly requires illustration.
I may give as instances, the conceit that the blood-stone is good lor
thern that bleed at the nose, with the quaere, whether ‘the stone
taken out os the toad's head be not os the like virtue, for the toad
loveth shade arrd coolness ⁸⁸ ;' the ‘report’ oi ‘the writers of natural
magic,' quoted apparently with approval, that ‘the heart ol an ape,
worn near the heart, comforteth the heart, and increaseth audacity,’
‘and that the same heart likewise ol an ape, applied to the neck or
head, helpeth the wit, and is good sor the falling sickness⁶⁹;' the
statement that ‘there be divers sorts ol bracelets fit to comfort the
spirits, and they be of three intentions‚ refrigerant, corroborant, and
aperient τος’ the suggestion to ‘try the force of imagination upon
staying the working ot' beer when the barm is put in, or upon the
coming of butter or cheese, after the chuming, or the rennet be put
in⁷¹;' the sections on the inlluences of the moon τ’ 3 the notion that
water is congealed into crystals ⁷³. Ι might, os course, greatly extend
this list, but there is no obiect in doing so. The reader, who is curious
in such matters, may refer to the tenth century, which is lull ol
absurdities ol this kind. On Bacon's behals, it may be pleaded that
these were the sancies ol his age, from which probably no man of that
time was altogether lree⁷⁴. We have only to look into books like
Sir Thomas Browne’s ‘Vulgar and Common Errors’ or the various
works of Joseph Glanville, to see how persistent such notions were
even in the generation after Bacon's death. Moreover, a large
number os them may be groupcd under the heads of ‘ sympathy and
antipathy,' ‘force of imagination,’ Sec, subjects on which peculiarly
obscure ideas prevailed at this time. Lastly, Bacon's very hopelul·
