duaa sunt sui similes Usus vero instantiarum monadica·
rum est talis qualis est instantiarum clandestinarum: viz. ad
evehendam et uniendam naturam ad invenienda genera sive
communes naturas, limitandas postea per differentias veras.
Neque enim desistendum ab inquisitione donec proprietates
et qualitates, quae inveniuntur in hujusmodi rebus quae pos-
sunt censeri pro miraculis naturae, reducantur et comprehen-
dantur sub aliqua forma sive lege certa: ut irregularitas sive
singularitas omnis reperiatur pendere ab aliqua forma com·
muni3 miraculum vero illud sit tandem solummodo in differ-
entiis accuratis et gradu et concursu raro, et non in ipsa
specie: ubi nunc contemplationes hominum non procedant
ultraquam ut ponant hujusmodi res pro secretis et magnali-
bus naturae, et tanquam incausabilibus, et pro exceptionibus
regularum generalium ³.

Exempla instantiarum monodiarum sunt, sol et luna, inter
astra ; magnes, inter lapides; argentum vivum, inter metalla3

³These remarks are truly philosophical. We ought never to rest
till exceptions are explained, aad, when explained, they will usually be
found to fall under some general law of nature, or, in the mse of moral
and social phenomena, to be what Dr. Tylor has happily called ‘survivals’
of some state of things which was far more general in the past. The
history of language, it may be noticed, is peculiarly rich in phenomena of
this kind.

SirJohn Herschel illustrates this instance as follows: ‘The discovery of
the magnetism of niclrel, which, though inferior to that of iron, is still con·
siderable; that of cobalt, yet feebler, aad that of timnium, which is only
barely perceptible, have effectually broken down the imaginary limit
between iron and the other materials of the world, and established the
existence of that general law of continuity which it is one chief business of
philosophy to trace throughout nature. The more recent discoveries of
M. Arago have completed this generalisation, by showing that there is
no substance but which, under proper circumstances, is capable of
exhibiting unequivoral signs of magnetic virtue. And to obliterate all
traces of that line of separation which was once so broad, we are now
enabled, by the great discovery of Oersted, to communicate at and during
pleasure to a coiled wire of any metal indifferently all the properties of
a magnet3-its attraction, repulsion, and polarity; and tlrat even in a
more intense degree than was previously thought to be possible in the
best natural magnets! Discourse, dac, ξ 364. Appended to the later
editions of Sir W. R. Grove's Correlation of Physical Forces is an
admirable Address, delivered before the British Association, oa the Law
of Continuity.
