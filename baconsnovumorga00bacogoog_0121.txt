parallelisms, therefore, between the two writers, however close in
some cases, are, I believe, accidental.

, Having thus dwelt with some minuteness on the anticipations of
Bacon’s teaching to be found in the works of his almost equally
1 illustrious namesake in the thirteenth century, l may pass more
lightly over the intermediate period.

Passing over about two centuries, during which, it may be noticed,
the precepts and example of Roget Bacon seem to have had little
effect (for the schools were engaged with far different work), we come
to that almost universal genius—painter, poet, sculptor, architect,
mechanist, mathematician, Leonardo da Vinci (b. 1452, d. 1519)¹².
Speaking of certain unpublished manuscripts by him, now in the
Library of the Institute at Paris, Libri (Histoire des Sciences Mathe‘·
matiques en Italie, tome 3. p. 30) says: ‘Souvent on trouve dans le
meme feuillet . . . des preceptes qui sembleraient tires de Bacon, s’ils

n’etaient ecrits longtemps avant la naissance du chancelier d'Angle
terre) And again (pp. 5 5, 56): ‘Dans ses notes. . . ce qui frappe
surtout, c'est la methode philosophique qu’il a constamment suivie.

senectutis accidentibus, which was published in latin at Oaford in 1590.

¹² Hallam, Libri, Whewell‚ Brewster, and De Remusat. all refer to J. B. Venturi,
Fssai sur les ouvrages Physicohfathdrnatiques de lionam de Vinci, Paris, 1799.
A copy of this tract, which is, 1 believe, very rare, exists in the Britisb Museum,
but 1 do not know whether the MSS. referred to in it have ever been publisbed in
full. Whewell quotes from Venturi the following striking maxims:

“‘ Theory is the general, Experiments are the soldiers. The interpreter of the
artifices of nature is Experience: she isnerer deceived. Our judgment sometimes
is deceived, because it expects effects which Experience refuses to allow.” And again,
“We must consult Experience‚ and vary the circumstances till we bave drawn from
them general rules; for it is she who furnishes true rules. But of what use. yon
ask, are these rules; 1 reply, that they direct usin the researchea of nature and the

operations of art They prevent our imposing upon ourselres and others by pro·
mising ourselves results which we cannot obtain.

‘⁴‘ in the study of the sciences which depend on Mathematios, those who do not
consult nature but authors, are not the children of nature, they are only her grand-
children. She is the true teacher of men of genius. But see the absurdity of meu l
They turn up their uoses at a man who prefers to leam from nature herself rather
than from authors who are only her clerks.”

‘lu another plane, in reference to a particulareme, he says, “Nature begins from
the Reason and ends in Experience; but for all that, we must take the opposite
course; begin from the Experiment and try to discover the Reaaon.''' Whewell's
Philosophy of Discovery, pp. 106, 107.

In Hallam’s History of Literature, Part i. ch. 3. sect. 5, to which the student
would do well to refer, there is a still fuller account of Venturi's tract.
