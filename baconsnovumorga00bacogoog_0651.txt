motus communi et inveterata opinione habetur pro proprio
coelestium. Attamen gravis de illo motu lis est inter non-
nullos tam ex antiquis quam modernis, qui rotationem terrae
attribuerunt. At multo sortasse justior⁰⁰ movetur controversia
(si modo res non sit omnino extra controversiam), an motus

videlicet iste (concesso quod terra stet) coeli finibus conti-
neatur, an potius descendat, et communicetur aeri et aquis ⁶¹.
Motum autem rotatiom‘s in missilibus, ut in spiculis, sagittis,
pilis sclopetorum, et similibus, omnino ad motum libertatis
rejicimus ⁸2.

(18) Sit Motus Decimus Octavus, Motus T repidatrom's, cui
(ut ab astronomis intelligitur) non multum fidei adhibemus ⁶³.
Nobis autern corporum naturalium appetitus ubique serio
perscrutantibus occurrit iste motus ; et constitui debere videtur
inspeciem. Est autern hic motus veluti aeternae cujusdam
captivitatis. Videlicet ubi corpora non omnino pro natura
sua bene locata, et tamen non prorsus male se habentia,

to circular motion, that is, unless we reject the sixth and seventb species
of variatim, it will not be necessary lor us to suppose the poles themselves
to be movable: in other words, that the phenomena ol which we could
by this hypothesis give an account maybe adequately represented without
it by means ol spirals.'

⁶⁰ This language, the reader will perceive, exactly accords with what
we have so osten elsewhere lound to be Bacon’s opinion not only as to the
annual, but also as to the diurnal motion ol the earth.

⁶¹ Cp. Aph. 36 (2), and notes.

⁶² See ‘Motus tertius’ above, and Aph. 3⁶ (6).

⁸⁸ ‘The name oi trepidation was given by the Alphonsine astronomers
to a motion by which they imagined the starry heaven to be affected, and
in virtue of which its equinoxes described small circles of nine degrees
radius about those oi the ninth or next superior orb. To account lor this
motion they introduced a tenth orb. The phenomenon, however, thus
accounted lor was altogether imaginary‚ although it is true that the length
of the tropical year, by supposed variations oi which the idea ol trepi-
tion was suggested, is not rigorously constant. lt may be questioned
whether Bacon’s hesitation to accept the astronomical motion of trepi-
dation had any better foundation than his doubts whether the proper
motione ol the planetary orbs were anything more than “res confictae et
suppositae.’' [See Aph. 36 (2).] The question oi the existence
or non-existence oi trepidation could only be decided by a person
conversant with the details of the received system oi astronomy.’ Mr.
Ellis’note.
