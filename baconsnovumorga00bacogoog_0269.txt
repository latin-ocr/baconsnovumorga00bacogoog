240 NOVUM ORGANUM.

sectae, similes illis, quae magna varietate olim apud Graecos
floruerunt, introductae fuissent. Quemadmodum enim super
phaenomena aetheris plura themata coeli confingi possunt3
similiter, et multo magis, super phaenomena philosophiae fun·
dari possunt et constitui varia dogmata. Atque hujusmodi
theatri fabulae habent etiam illud, quod in theatro poetarum
usu venit; ut narrationes fictae ad scenam narrationibus ex
historia veris concinniores sint¹ et elegantiores, et quales quis
magis vellet.

In genere autem, in materiam philosophiae sumitur aut
multum ex paucis, aut parum ex multis¹‘; ut utrinque
philosophia super experientiae et naturalis historiae nimis
angustam ¹⁵ basin fundata sit, atque ex paucioribus quam par
est, pronunciet. Rationale 11 enim genus philosophantium ex
experientia arripiunt varia et vulgaria, eaque neque certo
comperta, nec diligenter examinata et pensitata3 reliqua in

Ἴ meditatione atque ingenii agitatione ponunt.

Est et aliud genus philosophantium, qui in paucis experi-

¹‘ ‘Multum ex paucis’ evidently refers to the Empirical School, as
described below and in many other passages, and, consequently, ‘parum ex
multis' must refer to the Rational or Sophistic School. But its meaning,
as referred to this school, is not obvious, the charge against it usually being
that it founds propositione oi too wide a degree of generality on too
slender a basis of fact. Can the phrase mean that the first inferences
drawn by the Rational School, instead of being true ‘axiomata infima'
and therefore just coven'ng the facts and no more, are of too vague and
general a character, being based on a cursory view of a great number
oi facts, to be of any service with respect to subsequent inductions? The
whole passage might then be paraphrased as follows: ‘The Empirical
School examines minutely a small number of facts, and bases far too
many inferences upon them; the Rational or Sophistic School examines
cursorily a large number of facts, and infers from them too few conclu·
sions‚ while those conclusions are of so vague a character as to be prac-
tically useless! lt must be remembered that the ‘axiomata infima,' or
first inferences from the facts, would, according to Bacon's ideal, be
very numerous, and would fumish the basis for subsequent inductions
of various degrees.

¹³ In the first case, the basis of facts is too small; in the second case,
the ‘axiomata infima,’ from which subsequent axioms are to be inferred,
are too few.

¹⁶ Called below ‘Sophistio’ This division of philosophers trusts too
much to mere reasoning, as the next trusts too much to mere experience.
