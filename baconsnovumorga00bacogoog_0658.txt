induit ferrum nova partium dispositione et motu conformi3
ipse autem nihil ex virtute perdit. Similiter fermentum panis,
et flos cervisiae ³⁹, et coagulum lactis, et nonnulla ex venenis,
excitant et invitant motum in massa farinaria, aut cervisia,
aut cason, aut corpore humanu, successivum et continuatum3
non tam ex vi excitantis quam ex praedispositione et sacili
cessione excitati

(13) Sit Motus Decimus Tertius, Motus Impressrbnis⁴⁰;
qui motus est etiam ex genere motus assimilationis, estque
ex diffusivis motibus subtilissimus Nobis autem visum est
eum in speciem propriam constituere, propter differentiam

sensui nec experimento subjiciantur. Illa, curn a calore coelestium primo
longius, deinde penitus, semota sint, possint esse corporibus nobis notis
densiora’ ‘Cum fons densitatis videatur esse in profundo terrae, adeo
ut versus superficiem ejus corpora eximie extenuentur; illud notatu dig-
num est, quud aurum,' 810. He then proceeds to ask why gold, which is
so heavy, should be found on the surface 01 the earth.

³⁹ Yeast. ‘The flowerof beer! For cervisia, see Pliny, libxxii. ad fin.

ln consequence of the researches of Pasteur and others, the generally
received opinion as to the working of yeast and leaven is that it is due to

a chemical action set up by the life processes 01 minute organisms which Δ

have an indefinite power of seli-multiplication. (See Watts’ Dictionary of
Chemistry, art. ‘F ermentation‚’ both in vol. ii. and in the supplement.)
The opposed view, held by Liebig and others, attributing these changes
entirely to chemical and physical forceS, seems to have been set aside by
recent experimenta Hence, these phenomena must be regarded as illus·
trating the last section rather than the present one. Putrefaction (see
note 98 above) is a particular case of fermentation.

The coagulation of milk, when spontaneous, is also probably due 10
chemical action set up by minute living organisms. But, when produced
by artificial means, as by an aeid, the phenomenon is purely chemical, and
may, therefore, be regarded as an example 01 the ‘motus excitationis!

As to poisons‚ we must distinguish three cases. Some poisons, like
vaccinevirus, are due to the indefinite seli-multiplication 01 low organisms
within the body. Others, like arsenic, act purely chemically. Lastly‚a
third class, like chlorofonn or prussic acid, act, as it were, physiologically‚
by destroying the dynamical activity of some tissue or organ. 1 am
indebted for this division to the late Dr. Rolleston. The student will fmd
some interesting remarks on the action 01 poisons in Dr. Carpenter’s Human
Physiology, 8111 Ed, ἐξ 1109 (ch. 7). [Omitted in the 9111 Edition.]

⁴⁰ This ‘motus' is distinguished from the two last hythe continuance of
the original impressions being necessary to the continuance 01 the effects.
Thus light or sound ceases, when the source of the impression is with·
drawn.
