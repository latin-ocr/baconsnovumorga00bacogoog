REACTION AGAINST ARISTOTLE. 75

eis intelligere veraciter, sicut ego expertus sum omnino * * * * * *

Certus igitur sum, quod melius esset latinis, quod sapientia
Aristotelis non esset translata, quam tali obscuritate et perversitate
tradita, sicut eis qui ponuntur ibi triginta vel quadraginta annos;
et quanto plus laborant, tanto minus sciunt, sicut ego probavi in
omnibus qui libris Aristotelis adhaeserunt. Unde dominus Robertus,
quondam episcopus Lincolniensis sanctae memoriae, neglexit omnino
libros Aristotelis et vias eorum, et per experientiam propriam, et
auctores alios, et per alias scientias negotiatus est in sapientialibus
Aristotelis3 et melius centies milesies scivit et scripsit illa de quibus
libri Aristotelis loquuntur, quam in ipsius perversis translationibus
capi possunt. * * * * * * Si enim haberem potestatem super libros
Aristotelis ego iacerem omnes cremari, quia non est nisi temporis
amissio studere in illis, et causa erroris et multiplicatio ignorantiae,
ultra id quod valeat explicari. Et quoniam labores Aristotelis sunt
fundamenta totius sapientiae, ideo nemo potest aestimare quantum
dispendium accidit latinis, quia malas translationes receperunt
philosophi ⁷⁴3

Passing to the Renaissance, we find a tone oi expression very ι
different from the cautious and discriminative criticism os these early Ι
writers. Men, who had new theories to propound, had become
impatient of the constant appeal to authority, and in their minds
the name of Aristotle was associated with the ideas os indexihle
dogma and unreasoning opposition to enquiry. He was for them
the dictator, the tyrant os the schools, and, till he was dethroned,
there was no hope ior any regeneration ol science, or even for any
opportunity of sair discussion. Nor, considering the slavish deserence
which had long been paid to the name ot Aristotle, can this seel-
ing, however exaggerated and unreasoning the form which it osten
assumed, be regarded with surprise. It seems to have originated
chiefly amongst the Italian ‘novellists,' as they are called by Bacon,
and to have spread rapidly amongst all who were ioremost in the
revival either oi science or letters. The worlrs ot laurentius Valla,
Rodolphus Agricola, H. C. Agrippa, Ludovicus Vives, Paracelsus, ⁸
Nizolius, Ramus, Telesius, Patricius, Giordano Bruno, Campanella,
M. Aur. Severinus, Nicolaus Cabeus⁷⁶‚ and others, all teem with ²

'⁰ compendium Studii‚ cap. 8 (Brewer's Ed, pp. 468, 9). The whole passage
from which these extracu are taken ls very curious and well worth reading.

'¹ Much more moderate in their strictures were Cardan and Gallico, while
³ amongat the desenders oi Aristotle we may count Pompouatius (b. 1462, d. 1524
or 6) and Caeralpinus (b. 1519, d. 1603).
