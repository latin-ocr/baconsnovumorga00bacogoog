experimentis fornacis, philosophiam constituerunt phantas-

philosophy to his logie is undoubtedly founded in part on his partiality for
the technical forms and terminology of the syllogism. This circumstance
often obscures his argument las we may see even in the 6th and 7th Books
of the Ethics), and also often has a tendency to divert his attention from
the arbitrary or questionable character of the principles on which his
reasoning proceeds. But, under the phrase ‘logicae suae,’ Bacon probably
includes not only ‘logie' properly so called, but also the metaphysical dis-
tinctions which are of such frequent occurrence in Aristotle's works.
Instead of explaining physical phenomena in their true relations or by
reference to their true causes, Aristotle frequently, if not generally, dcems
it sufficient to bringtlrem underhis metaphysical distinctionsof δύναμις and
ἐνέργεια, matter, form, and privation, the four causes, the ten categories,
the different kinds of motion, and the like. Of this tendency we have
a notable instance in the De Coelo, where we should naturally expect to
find a careful account of observed facts with reference to the earth and
the heavenly bodies; instead of this account, we have interminable
discussions on substance, qualities, the various kinds of motion, and other
topica of a like metaphysical character. The title of this treatise, how-
ever, was not given by Aristotle himself.

⁸¹ Bacon frequently refers to the ‘Chemists' or ‘Alchemists' and gene-
rally in the same terms. See Aphs. 64 and 73. They are criticised at
length, both on their practical and speculative side, in the Redargutio
Philosophiamm (E. and S., iii. 575, 576). There is also an interesting
notice of them in the De Augmentis, lib. i. (vol. i. p. 457).

ln the word ‘phantasticam’ he probably has specially in view the
speculatione of Paracelsus and his school; in the expression ‘ad pauca
spectantem' the narrow range of objects, such as the transformation of

metals and the discovery of the elixir vitae, to which the Chemists or .

Alchemists of that time confined their attention.

Professor Playfair‚ in a passage already referred to, says (Encycl.
Brit, Prel. Diss.): ‘Chemistry in this state might be said to have an
Elective Attraction for all that was most absurd and extravagant in the
other parts of knowledge!

⁹² William Gilbert of Colchester (1540-1603), Coun-Physician to Queen
Elisabeth and author of the celebrated treatise ‘De Magnete’ published
in 1600, was really the founder of the sciences of Electricity and Mag-
netism. lt is, however, indisputable that he regarded his discoveries as =
admitting oi a wider application than was really the case Thus, he
assigned to magnetism some of the phenomena which were afterwards

explained by gravitation.
