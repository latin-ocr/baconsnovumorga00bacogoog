m -' INTRODUCTION.

improver of science in several of its branchos, and who was placed
in a situation, which, in a particular manner, enabled him to collect
the general sentiment of Europe upon any point connected with the
history of philosophy, in his Discourse de comparando certo in
Physicis, delivered before the University of Leyden in 1715, pro
nounced an eulogium on Bacon which it would be difficult to exceed:
‘Atque hujus quidem Physices fortunas laudare licet ex quo magnum
Verulamium summo suo bono accepit! Virum certe ad omnia, quae
scientia humana comprehendi possunt, indaganda facile principem,
et de quo dubites utrum consilio, an exemplo, major fuerit in in-
stauranda deformata Physica Absque invidia dixero, quidquid
incrementi cepit naturalis historia ab ineunte decimo sexto seculo
in hanc usque horam, omne id acceptum debemus monitis et pre-
ceptis illius viri; cujus indelibilem memoriam grata colet orbis
perpetuitas!

Similar is the testimony of Buddaeus (Compendium Historiae
Philosophicae, Ed. of 1731, pp. 409-412): ‘Saeculo decimoseptimo

· ineunte, nova lux philosophiae, praesertim in scientia naturali, orta

est. Exemplum omnibus praeivit Franciscus Baco de Verulamio, qui,
ut, missis abstractis illis et otiosis speculationibus, ad particularia
descenderent experimentaque instituendo naturam rerum accuratius
contemplarentur, omnibus auctor fuit. Hujus ductum cum multi
sequerentur, dici non potest, quanta ad accuratiorem philosophiam
facta sit accessio!

Morhof (Polyhistor, torn. i. lib. a. cap. 7) speaks of a work,
published in Hungary in 1663, by one John Beyer, entitled ‘F ilum
Labyrinthi wel Cynosura, sive Lux mentium universalis,' dte, in which
the author attempted to expound tbe Baconian philosophy. ‘Verum
obscurat potius Verulamii sensus omnemque philosophiam, quam ut
lumen aliquod accendat.’ This fact is interesting as shewing that
the fame of Bacon’s philosophical reform had reached even remote
countries like Hungary.

On the possible, or, perhaps, probable influence of Bacon's writings
on the institution of scientific societies abroad, I shall have occasion
to speak in a note on the next division of my subject.

Retuming to England,I shall now attempt to shew the influence of
Bacon’s writings on the group of men who founded the Royal Society
or were amongst its earliest members, and the estimation in which he
was held by them. This Society, as is well known, originated in certain
