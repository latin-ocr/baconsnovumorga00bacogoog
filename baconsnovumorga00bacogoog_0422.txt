ΗΒ. ΙΙ. 13. 393

focis videre est per gelu acre⁶⁴. Quod existimamus fieri non
tantum per conclusionem et contractionem caloris, quae est
species unionis, sed per exasperationem; veluti cum adr aut
baculum violenter comprimitur aut flectitur, non ad punctum
loci prioris resilit, sed ulterius in contrarium. Itaque fiat dili-
gens experimentum per baculum vel simile aliquid immissum
in flammam, utrum ad latera flammae non uratur citius quam
in medio fiammae.

37. Gradus autem in susceptione caloris sunt complures
Atque primo omnium notandum est, quam parvus et exilis
calor etiam ea corpora, quae caloris minime omnium sunt
susceptiva, immutet tamen et nonnihil calefaciat. Nam ipse
calor manus globulum plumbi aut alicujus metalli paulisper
detentum nonnihil calefacit. Adeo facile et in omnibus
transmittitur et excitatur calor, corpore nullo modo ad
apparentiam immutato.

38. Facillime omnium corporum apud nos et excipit et
remittit calorem aer⁶53 quod optime cernitur in vitris calen-
daribus. Eorum confectio est talis ⁶⁶: accipiatur vitrum ventre

⁸⁴ This circumstance is due to the increased draught produced by the
differenee between the temperatures of the internal and externat air, and,
consequentiy, to the more frequent reuewal of the supplies of oxygen
which are, ordinarily, a condition of combustion. See note 60 above.

'Ibe ideas of exasperation and imitation, as applied to these phenomena,
are peculiarly fanciful.

⁸⁶ As Ι have before said, air is a bad conducturos heat. lt was on
account of its expansive and not on account of its conductive capacity
that it served roughly as a thermometer, before the substitution, first of
alcohol, and then of mercury.

‘⁸ Mr. Ellis remarks: ‘I am very much inclined to think that Bacon
heard of the vitrum mleudare from Fludde, or a Fluctibus, as he is called
in Latin, who returned from Italy in [1605], and in whose philosophy,
built upon certain abstract notions ol rarefaction and condensation, per·
petual reference is made to the air-thermometer, to which he gives the
saruc name!

As 1 have already noticed in note 83 on tbe last Aphorism‚ the invention·
ol the thermometer hasbeen ascribed to several persons, including Galileo,
Drebbel, and, though on insufficient grounds, even Bacon himself. See
also Introduction, p. 43, u. 19. Mr. Ellis has a long note on the invention
of the Thermometer (vol. i. p. 255. n. ι). Το this note, which is too long
for quotation, I must refer the reader who is specially interested in the
questlon.
