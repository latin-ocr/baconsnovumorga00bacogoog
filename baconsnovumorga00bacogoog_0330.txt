Nemo adhuc tanta mentis constantia et rigore inventus est,
ut decreverit et sibi imposuerit theorias et notiones communes
penitus abolere, et intellectum abrasum et aequum ad par·
ticularia de integro applicare ⁷⁶. ltaque r'atio illa humana,

calculations, into all their ramilieations and applicatione. lt is needless
to add that the magnificent achievements of modern science (witness, lor
instance, the Principia or Optics oi Newton, or the Mecenique Analytique
oi Lagrange) have been due at least as much to mathematical calculation
as to inductive generalisation. The more advanced sciences, in lact,
become, in their later stages, mainly mathematical. But, while a science
remains in its earlier, or inductiva, stage, it is only capable ol matbematieal
treatment, irat all, to a very slight degree. This, for instance, is still the
case with the sciences ol chemistry and physiology.

The parallel passage in Bk. ii. Aph. 8 (ι Optime autern cedit inquisitio
naturalis quando physicum terminatur in mathematico ’l appears to apply
specially to the enumeration and mensuration of the ultimate particles ol
matter, as conceived by Bacon. Hence, it might be contended that his
, view ol the iunctions ol Mathematics in the present Aphorism is equally
limited. But l am inclined to think that here the remark has a much
wider bearing, and that the office of Mathematics, as contemplated in ii. 8,
would be only a special exemplification ol the iunctions here ascribed to
them.

ln the Parasceve, Aph. 7, the relation of physics and mathematica is
selicitously, though vaguely, stated as follows: ‘Physica autem et mathe-
matica bene commistae generant practicam!

⁷⁶ Tbese remarks remind us oi Descartes, who may possibly have been
intluenced by reading this passage and the Aphorisms on the Idola. For
an account ol the process by which he attempted to clear his mind os
preconceived notioris, see the First Meditation‚ or the beginning of the
First Part ol the Principia, or the earlier portion of the Dissertatio de
Methodo. The completeness with which he attempted to carry out his
purpose may be judged ol by the following briei passage, taken lrom the
De Methodo: ‘Sed quod ad eas opiniones attinet, quas ego ipse in enm
usque diem sueram amplexus, nihil melius iacere me posse arbitrabar,
quamsi omnes simulet semel e mente mea delerem, ut deinde vel alias
meliores vel certe easdem, sed postquam maturae rationis examen subiis-
sent, admitterem: credebamque hoc pacto longe melius me ad vitam
regendam posse informari, quarn si yeteris aedificii fundamenta retinerem,
iisque tantum principiis inniterer, quibus olim juvenilis aetas mea, nullo
unquam adhibito examine an veritati congruerent, credulitatem suam
addixerat?
