120 INTRODUCYION.

was but one named 3 but it is excused, that his list was much too
short, and that he wanted time to complete it, and for some reasons
he would not be seen to advise with others for fuller information'
There are excellent professors', some lecturers, and very many students
of useful arts amongst them. And in time they may have their
meetings in some of their publick schools, after fit lectures3 and the
wings of the Stubbians are already broken, and their reputation
withers, as Dr. Bathurst told me! Boyle's Works, Ed. of 1744,
vol. v. p. 498, b.

Mr. Napier, to whom I am indebted for the two next references,
thinks that the ‘new philosophy' had made still greater progress at
Cambridge. This conclusion is based mainly on a passage in Antony
Wood (Bliss’s ed. of the Athenae Oxonienses, 1817, vol. iii. p. 1244),
who, in his Life of Glanvill, ‘wonders considering that that house
[Exeter College] was then one of the chief nurseries for youth in
the university, why he should afterwards lament that his friends did
not first send him to Cambridge, because, as he used to say, that
new philosophy and the art of philosophising were there more than
here in Oxon, and that his first studies in this university did not
qualify him for the world of action and business’ This evidence,
which 1 have thought better to give in full, may not be of much
value as settling the claims of the rival Universities, but, at all events,
it is sufficient to shew that Cambridge had alreadya reputation for
the ‘new philosophy! Of this fact, perhaps, we receive additional
testimony in Baker’s Reiiections upon learning, first published in
1699. The author was a Fellow of St. John's College‚ Cambridge,
andis now well known for his history of that College‚ recently pub
lished and edited by Mr. Mayor. In the former work (Chapter on
Logic), after making some interesting remarks on the Method of
Bacon, he proceeds: ‘After the way of free thinking' (notice, again,
this expression) ‘had been lai'd open by my Lord Bacon, it was soon
after greedily follow’d, for the Understanding affects Freedom as well
as the Will, and men will pursue liberty, tho it ends in confusion.’
p. 59. This reflexion, however, may have simply a general reference,
and may not have been specially suggested by the experience of the
writer’s own University.

A still stronger indication, than either of these two, of the way
which the ‘new philosophy' had made in Cambridge, in the middle
of the seventeenth century, is to be found in the testimony of Isaac
Barrow (1652), subsequently the first Lucasian Professor of Mathe
matics, and the immediate predecessores Newton. In an academical
