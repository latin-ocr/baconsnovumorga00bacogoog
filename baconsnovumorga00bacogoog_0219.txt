SUMMARY OF BOOK l.

THE First Book of the Novum Organum, which was designed to be a
sort of introduction to the whole work, is called in the Partis Secundae
Delineatio (Ellis and Spedding‚ vol. iii. p. 552) ‘pars praeparans‚' in
opposition to the ‘pars informans,'. which was to be comprised in the
remaining books. The following brief account of its contents may be
of service to the reader. Aphs. 1-31 consist of certain preliminary remarks,
chiefly on the futility of the methods of enquiry at present in use and
the necessity of a more faithful study of Nature. ln Aphs. 32-37‚ Bacon
makes a kind of apology for the introduction of a new method. Aphs.
38-70 contain the doctrine of the ldola, to which he justly attaches the
utmost importance. ‘Primo enim mentis area aequanda, et liberanda
ab eis quae hactenus recepta sunt! (Partis Secundae Delineatio, Ellis
and Spedding, vol. iii. p. 548.) Then follow the signs, five in number, of
the weakness and inutility of preceding philosophias (Aphs. 71-77). These
are followed by the causes, fifteen in number, of so long continuante in
error (Aphs. 78-92). ln the middle of Aphorism 92, he passes on to
the Grounds of Hope in the future progress of Science. Tbese are
twenty-one, and occupy Aphs. 92-115. The next three Aphorisms contain
three cautious or wamings. Aphs. 119-121 contain three apologies. Then
follow the answers to four possible objections (Aphs. 122-126). The next
Aphorism is of great importance, as vindicating for the application of his
method not only the field of natural, but also that of moral and mental

¹ science. The remainder of the Book (Aphs. 128-130) consists of certain

miscellaneous remarks, forming the transition to Book ii.
