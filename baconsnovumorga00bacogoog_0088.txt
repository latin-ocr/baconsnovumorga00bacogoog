motion, or whiteness in a certain juxtaposition 01 particles, we are

already acquainted with the law 01 115 development or cause 01 115
production. Or, to take Lasalle's instance 01 ‘Form’ (which seems
to me a very good one), 11 we are acquainted with Newton's analysis
oi a white ray of light into the several coloured rays 01 which it is
composed, it is indifferent whether we speak 01 11050 rays as consti-
tuting (=being the essence 01) whiteness, or as producing (=being
the cause oi) whiteness. And, as substances or concrete bodies were,
according to Bacon’s conception, ‘ ionnae copulatae,’ or combinations
01 certain ‘simple natures,’ a knowledge 01110 ‘essence’ would, in
their case also, be equivalent to a knowledge 01 110 ‘cause' So far,
indeed, did Bacon carry this idea that 10 supposed that, is we could
ever attain (as he did not despair of attaining) to a knowledge 01 110
various ‘simple natures' which constitute substances, we should be
able, by superimposing them severally‚ one on the other, to produce
the substance in question. See, sor instance, the beginning 01 110
511 ¹Aphorism oi the Second Book 01 110 Novum Organum, which
furnishes a good example both 01 110 simplicity which he ascribed to
Nature and 01 the sanguine expectations which he had formedoi our
ultimate power over 115 operations.

The great difference which Bacon himself conceived as distinguish·
ing his own doctrine of Forms lrorn that 01 110 Schoolmen was that,
whereas, with them, the ‘Form' simply replaced the thing 10 10 ,
explained by some empty abstraction, with him, the ‘Form’ was to
set forth the several conditions on which 110 phenomenon was de
pendent, and thus render possible its artificial production. That
this conception, however obscurely and ambiguously it is often
stated, is an eminently just and fertile one, cannot be doubted.

The reader, who is acquainted with the logie 01 Aristotle, will 101
fail to notice the parallel between Bacon's conception 01 ‘Form,’ as
including the ideas 01 essence, delinition, and cause, and that class 01
essentinl delinitions 11 which the cause ol the term defined is set iorth
in the definition, as, 101· instance, τί δ’ ἐστὶ βροντὴ; ψόφος ἂποσβεννυμέ· ου
πυρὸς ἐν νέφεσιν (Α1. Ρο51. ii. 10). To know a thing (thath, to know
its essence) and to know its cause are frequently stated by Aristotle
to be identical. Thus, τὸτί ἐστιν aldiran ταῦτόὲστι 111111 ri ἐστιν. An.
Post. ii. 2⁴¹.
