486 NOVUM ORGANUM.

meditullia flammae, quae aer non contingit sed alia flamma
undique circumdat, eadem numero manent, neque extinguuntur
donec paulatim angustiemur ab atre per latera circumfuso.
Itaque omnis flamma pyramidalis est basi circa fomitem lar·
gior, vertice autem (inimicante ae're, nec suppeditante fomite)
acutior. At fumus angustior circa basin ascendendo dilatatur,
et fit tanquam pyramis inversa; quia scilicet ae'r fumum re-
cipit, flammam (neque enlm quispiam somniet aerem esse
flammam accensam, cum sint corpora plane heterogenea ²²)
comprimit ²³.

Accusatior autem poterit esse instantia crucis ad hanc rem
accommodata, si res forte manifestari possit per flammas
bicolores. Capiatur igitur situla parva ex metallo, et in ea
ligatur parva candela cerea accensa; ponatur situla in patera,
et circumfundatur spiritus vini in modica quantitate, quae ad
labra situlae non attingat; tum accende spiritum vini. At
spiritus ille vini exhibebit flammam magis scilicet caeruleam,
lychnus candelae autem magis flavam. N otetur itaque utrum
flamma lychni (quam facile est per colorem a flamma spiritus
vini distinguere3 neque enirn flammae, ut liquores, statim com-

miscentur) maneat pyramidaliS, an potius magis tendat ad
formam globosam, cum nihil inveniatur quod eam destruat
aut comprimat 2⁴. At hoc posterius si fiat, manere flammam

²¹² Here we may observe the influence of the old doctrine of the four
elements, of which air and fire were two.

²⁸ The pyramidal form of flame is due to the fact that, while one of its
constituents (oxygen) is equally diflused, the other has a definite source
The nearer this latter (which, in its pure condition, constitutes the
‘unbumt core ¹) is to its source, the larger is its volume3 for the further
it recedes from its source, the larger is the amount of it which is consumed.
Smoke, on the other hand, not entering into combination or conflict with
any other body, is able to difluse itself freely, and, hence, assumes the
form described in the text. ln a certain sense, therefore, Bacon is right
in ascribing the form of flame to its contact with the surrounding air.

¹⁴ A full account of this experiment is given in Sylva Sylvarum, Exp. 31.
Mr. Ellis there remarks: ‘The explanation of this experiment is simply
that in impure air flames increase in siae because the heated vapour of
which they are composed diffuses itself before it meets with sufficient
oxygen for complete combustion’

Bacon may, perhaps, be credited with having seen, in a dim sort of way,
that air bad some connection with flame, but the whole of this speculation,
like the two preceding ones, is wide of the mark.
