BACON’S RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 45

penned the above sentences might readily be suspected of harboun'ng
iu his mind a still greater mistrust oi theological conclusions than hc
overtly expresses3 and it is, at the same time, 1 think, no less easy to
see, if we know anything of the history of opinion, that the maxims
expressed might iu Bacon's age, when speculations of this kind and
the comparison of conclusione arrived at in different branches of
knowledge were comparatively rare, be uttered, even bya man of the
most religious temperament‚ in perfect good-faith.

1 arn myself of opinion not only that the religious side of these s
Aphorisms expresses Bacon's sincere convictione, but also that he did
not materially dissent from the religious teaching, which was generally
currentia his day, on what may be called the fundamental doctrines
of Christianity.

ln order to arrive at an independent opinion on this point, 1 will
ask the reader, who is interested in the question, carefully to compare
the following references (which are, of course, far too long to be
extracted): Nov. Org. i. 65, 89 ; De Augmentis, lib. i. (E. and S.,
vol. i. pp. 433-437), iii. a, iii. 4, ix. throughout ς Essays on Unity
in Religion, Atheism, and Superstition ; and, lastly, Bacon's formal
Confession of Faithffl. Of this last piece, however, it should be
stated that it first appeared in the Remains (1648), and that, as it is
described in the Harleian MS.²¹ as by Mr. Bacon, it must have been
written before the summer of 1603. Thus, it may possibly (though
1 have no positive reason for saying that it is so) enter into more
minute details of doctrine than Bacou would afterwards have been
disposed to do. To the Christian Paradoxes I do not refer, as being
now known to have been written by another hand ²¹.

On carefully considering these and the other passages in which
Bacon alludes to religion, or handles religious subJects, the im-
pression left on my mind may be summed up in the following
conclusions.

rst. Notwithstanding his admiration for the philosophy of Demo
critus, and his rejection of Fiual Causes from the domain of Physics,

¹⁰ For which aee F. and S, vol. vii. pp. 215-226.

'¹ MS. 1893. fo. r, as referred to by Mr. Speddiug.

² Namely by Herbert Palmer. The pieee is included iu the second part of his
Memorials of Godliness nod Christianity. This fact was discovered hythe Rev.
Alexander Grosar‘c Much doubt had previously attached to the piece, in conse·
queuce of its not being included in the collectione of either Rawley or Tenison,
though it appeared in the Remains of 1648. For the curiour history of the piece,
aud the various conjectures about it, see De Re'mnsat, p. 150. note r, E. and S.,

vol. vii. p. 289, and, especially, Sperlding’s letters aud Life, vol. vi. pp. rap-131.
