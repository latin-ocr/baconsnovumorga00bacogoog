Verum hujusmodi motus non est tam rapidus ut excitet
calorem, et iit secundum totum, non per particulas¹⁸3 ut
mirum non sit, si non generet calorem.

adunas· Circa hanc instantiam iacienda est inquisitio dili·
gentior. Videntur enim herbae et vegetabilia viridia et hu·
mida aliquid habere inse occulti caloris. ille vero calor tam
tenuis est ut in singulis non percipiatur ad tactum: verum
postquam illa adunata sint et conclusa, ut spiritus ipsorum
non expiret in aerem sed se invicem foveat, tum vero oritur
calor manifestus, et nonnunquam flamma in materia congrua ¹⁹.
nura-2⁴2 Etiam circa hanc instantiam diligentior iacienda
est inquisitio. Videtur enim calx viva aqua aspersa concipere
calorem vel propter unionem caloris qui antea distrahebatur
(ut ante dictum est de herbis conclusis), vel ob irritationem

the air. Cp. what Aristode says in the passage quoted above about the
heating oi arrows.

¹⁷ The cooling effect in these cases is due to the fact that fresh draugbts
oi air are constantly brought into contact with the body, the loss ol heat
from the latter being thus rendered more rapid than it would be it the
surrounding atmosphere were more nearly oi the same temperatura with
itseli.

¹⁸ From this passage, it would appear as is Bacon thought that masses
oi air could be put in motion, without causing any disturbance or iric·
tion amongst their minute particles—a view in which he was, oi course,
wrong.

¹⁹ This is a well-known phenomenon, as in damp hay-ricks, cosi-dust,
heaps oi decaying vegetable matter, masses oi rags or tow saturated with
oil, &c Bacon's explanation, it is unnecessary to say. is wholly unscientific.
The following is given in Watts' Dictionary ol Chemistry‚ art. Combus-
tion: ‘The substance absorbs and condenses the air within its pores;
oxidation then commences immediately and raises the temperature, which
again accelerares the oxidation; and thus the process goes on with con-
tinually increasing rapidity, till at length the mass bursts into flame. The
low conducting power ol such a porous mass greatly facilitates the com·
bustion, by preventing the dissipation oi the heat generated. * ⁴* * ⁴
The presence ol moisture greatly promotes the spontaneous ignition oi
porous substances, such as hay or cml-dust, the water probably supplying
oxygen to the combustible matter! Where the masses are small, the heat
developed is usually carried off ; so that combustion‚ in materials oi this
character, is sar more likely to take place in large masses than small.

ThuS, in a hay-rici< the process may be arrested by pulling the rick to
preces.
