reasons indeed so cogent that they are amongst those which have
led to considerable modifications of that theory ⁰⁶.

l conceive, then, with regard to this point, that, on the whole, Ihave
made out a case, if not for acquittal, at least sor very considerable
mitigation oi judgment. Bacon appears, in early lise, like the
majority, probably, oi even his scientific contemporaries, to have
conceived a strong prejudice against the Copernican theory. ln
middle liie, he seems for a time to have wavered, or, at least, to have
felt some hesitation, though never, I believe, to the extent oi adopting
the theory oi the earth's motion. The reasons against the theory,
probably, appeared to him more and more decisive, till at last, with
advancing age, he became positive in his opposition to it. Now,
surely, this is a piece ol mental history so common, and one to which
we are all, in turn, so liable, that, before casting our stone at Bacon,
we may at least pause to consider the circumstances of his age, the
attitude with respect to the same question assumed by his contem-
poraries, and the amount os evidence by which the doctrine he
rejected was at that time supported. To parallel cases there is no
limit, but I may specially mention the tenacity with which many
English mathematicians adhered to the Cartesian system long aster
the publication ol Newton’s discoveries (which, unlike those oi
Copernicus, possessed demonstrative force), the tardy reception oi
those discoveries on the continentes Europe, and the obstinate
resistance offered by Leibnitz to the Newtonian doctrine of Gravi-
tation⁹⁷. Not only are we liable, as I have already intimated, to
' ascribe to atheory now fully established a degree of perfectiora and
an amount oi evidence which it did not at first possess, and then
express our surprise that it was not at once universally welcomed‚

⁹⁰ One oi there, the triple motion oi the earth, as conceived by Copemicus, seems
¹to have been amongst the reasons which prevented Gilbert irom positively adopting
the theory nithe orbital motion, though be was au enthusiastic adherent of the
theory nithe diurnal motion. See his posthumous work, De Mundo Nostro
Sublunarl, lib. il. cap. ao.

⁹¹ All these cases are mentioned in the last section oi Playsair's Dissertation,
aiter bis account oi Newton's discoveries. He enters at some length on the two
former. For the last (which appears to me a much stronger case oi prejudice, in-
veteracy oi habit, or whatever we like to call it, than that of Bacon), the reader
should refer to the letters which passed between Clarke and leibnitz. The passage
in the text on the English mathematicians is stated in a more qualibed manner than
in the lonner edition, and is no longer restricted to Cambridge mathematicians
