(a) Though it cannot be said with truth that Aristotle never tried
experimenta, still it must be confessed that he did so very rarely.
lhe following interesting examples (interesting mainly because they
are so rare) are given by Mr. Lenes. ‘He refers to the experiment of
tying or removing the right testis of the male, previous to congress,
in disproof of the hypothesis that the sexes are derived from the right

and left testes. He refers to the experinrent of removing the eyes
from young birds, to show that these organs are capable of being

reproduced, a capability not observed in adult birds. Although he
places the seat of motive power in the heart, yet he refers to the
experiment of removing the heart from tortoises, after which they
still continue for some time to move; and to prove that the nutritive
soul is contained in the centre, he refers to the insects whose heads
and limbs may be removed without destroying their vitality.' Mr.
Lewes adds with regard to the last experiment: ‘The fact is incor-
rectly stated. The separated head will live almost as long as the
body ; and 1 have often found the hinder part of a triton live and
move for hours after its separation from the body.' See Lewes’
Aristode, pp. 112, 3. 1 do not recollect any experiments proposed
by Aristotle in any branch of natural science other than physiology.

(3) He frequently adopted traditional beliefs or stories, some even
which appear to us to be of a ridiculous character, without any further
investigation. To say nothing of the doctrine of the Elements, the
popular notions about gravity and levity, and the like, 1 may instance
from his physiological works the curious statements about the lion, aS,
for example, that it has only one bone in its neck, but no cervical
vertebrae (Hist. An. ii. 1 (3) ), the story that the hen-partridge
is impregnated by hearing the voice or smelling the breath of the

male bird (De Gen. Anim. iii. 1 (26, dccl), and the statement,
adopted probably frorn Herodotus, that the crocodile moves its upper
jaw (Hist. An. i. 11 (ιο) and iii. 7 (4) ). For additional instanceS, see
the Article in the Quarterly Review, above referred to. Sometimes as

in the case of the cranium of the dog, which he supposes to consist of
asingle bone (Hist. An. iii. 7(3)) it is difficult to say whether the mis-
take is ducto defective observation or to the unsuspecting reception
of a popular belief, or, lastly, to over-hasty generalisation.

(4) The fault just notieed was also undoubtedly the cause of many
of Aristotle’s errors. Though, perhaps, he was not without the con-

the extreme carelessness often attributed to Aristotle’s habits of observation, Dr.
william Ogle's introductiou to his translation of the De Partibus Animalium.
