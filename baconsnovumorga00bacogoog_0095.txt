ln the second place, even though we may regard the analogy of
human actions (which are always directed to some specific end, and
that too one which usually admits of being ascertained without
much difficulty) as wrongly applied to the processes of nature, it does
not follow that there is no plan whatsoever in the operations of
nature, or even that such plan may not, at least in its broad outlines‚
admit of being discovered by us. Of the ‘work which God worketh
from the beginning to the end,' namely the ‘summary law of nature,'
Baeon does indeed declare that ‘it may fairly be doubted whether
man's inquiry can attain to it⁵⁷,' but, at the same time, we may attain
to a sufficiently clear vision of that work to perceive, at least, the
power, the wisdom, and the goodness of the source from which it
issues, foolish and inadequate as may bc our guesses with regard
to the details of the scheme. And this, 1 think, is the answer which
Bacon himself would have made to any one who had charged him
with inconsistency in his different utterances on this, one of the rnost
difficult questions which presents itself in the course of human
speculation.

It is an entirely distinct question whether Bacon acted rightly in
expelling the consideration of F inal Causes so completely as he pro-
posed to do from the domain of Physics, and it is certainly a curious
commentary on his procedure that, at the very time when he was
composiug the Novum Organum, Harvey was employing this very
mode of reasoning in the famous researches which resulted in the
discovery of the Circulation of the Bloodv. Nor would any oue, Ι
presume, now deny that the idea of fitnction, which implies so much
of the idea of Final cause as is included in the word adaptatrbn
as distinct from design, is a conception absolutely essentinl to the
successful prosecution of at least one science, that of physiology.
And, even in the higher sciences of psychology, ethics, and politics,
there are few enquirers who can avoid from time to time asking the

question, what purpose does such and such a constituent subserve in
the mental, moral, or social economy. in chemistry‚ mineralogy,

know alike from the testimony of Rawley aud from iuternal evidence that Bacon
thoroughly revised the work, as it was undergoing translation, and, moreover, in
this very passage there are several alterations, including the important addition ut
the end.

θ’ Harvey began publioly to teach this doctrine in 1619, though his work on the
subject was not published till 1628. llis discovery set out from observing the
action of the valves iu the veins of many parts of the body, and enquiring into their
purpose, assuming, of course, that they had some purpose or other.
