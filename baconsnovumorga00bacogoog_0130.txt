BACON'S INFLUENCE ΟΝ SCIENCE. 101

(p. 270), there is another allusion to Bacon: ‘Ad haec intelligendum,
saltem quoad methodus exigit, non est opus naturam mentis per
primam eius causam cognoscere, sed sufficit mentis sive percep-
tionum historiolam concinnare modo illo quo Verulamius docet.'

The second question is, to my mind, much more difficult to answer
than the first, though I can entertain no doubt that Bacon has exerted
a real and beneficial influence on the subsequent progress of science.
The extentos this influence, however, and its precise character are
not easy to determine.

The best mode oi proceeding, perhaps, is to lay before the render,
in chronological order, the testimonies to Bacon's influence and to the
valuc oi his method (the attacks or innuendos of his opponents are
noticed elsewhere), and then to attempt briefly to estimate the direc-
tion in which his intluence was exerted and the value historieally, as
bearing on the subsequent progress of seleuce, oi the rules and
maxims which he enlorces.

so interesting that I cannot refrain stom extracting a portion oi it: ‘Ihave your
