¹ ‘bacon here speaks in accordance with the medical theory in which
the brain is the origin and seat ol the rheum, which descende from thence
and produces disease in other organs—a theory preserved in the word
catarrh. Certain purgatives were supposed to draw the rheum down.’
hir. Ellis’ note.

¹⁰ On the mutual attraction ol magnete ior one another, see Gilbert, De
Magnete, lib. i. cap. 5.

¹¹ ‘A little below the suriace.’ Cp. Gilbert, De Magnete, lib. i. cap. 17:
‘Talis igitur nobis est tellus in interioribus partibus, magneticam homo-
genicam naturam babens,' &c

The earth may be compared with an immense magnet, whose poles,
though variable, approach more or less nearly to the terrestria} poles, and
whose neutral line cuts the equatur at very acute angles.

¹¹ Cp. ii. 36 (3) and 37, with notes.

¹³ See ii. 35 and 36 (ι), with notes. ln both these places, he is speaking
ol the ebb and iiow which takes place twice a day. Here, he speaks os
the spring and neap tides, each ol which occurs twice a month, namely at
new and iuli moon and at the first and last quartem, respectively.

lt is curious to note Bacon’s change oi opinion with regard to the cause
os these semi-menstrual phenomena; for in the De Fluxu et Refluxu
Maris, written before or not long aster 1616, he rejects the hypothesis
oi the influencc oi the moon, using, as his main argument, the lact that,
when the moon is in opposite conditions‚ namely new and iuli moon, the
same tidal phenomena take place. ‘Et multaalia,’ he adds, ‘adduci possint
quae hujusmodi dominationum phantasias destruant, et eo potius rem
deducant, ut ex materiae passionibus catholicis et primis rerum coagmen-
tationibus consensus illi oriantur, non quasi alterum ab altero regatur, sed
quod utrumque ab iisdem originibus et concausis emanet.¹ E. and S,
vol. iii. p. 52.

On the semi-diumal ebb and flow, it will be remembered, Bacon was
probably inclined to adopt an entirely different theory. See note 57 on

Aph. 35.
