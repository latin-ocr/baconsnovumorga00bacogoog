circa polos positos iuxta Ursas potius quam circa Orionem,
aut ex alia aliqua parte coeli⁴⁹: videtur ista quaestio tanquam
quaedam extasis ⁵⁰, curn ista potius ab experientia, et ut posi·
tiva ⁵¹ recipi debeant. At in natura proiecto sunt quaedam
ultima et incausabilia; verum hoc⁵² ex illis non esse videtur.
Etenim hoc fieri existimamus ex quadarn hannonia et con-
sensu mundi, qui adbuc non venit in observationem. Quod
si recipiatur motus terrae ab occidente in orientem, eaedem
manent quaestiones. Nam et ipsa super aliquos polos move-
tur. Atque cur tandem debeant isti poli collocari magis ubi
sunt quam alibi? Item verticitas, et directio, et declinatio
magnetis ad hunc motum referuntur. Etiam inveniuntur in
corporibus tam naturalibus quarn artificialibus, praesertim
consistentibus et non fluidis, collatio' quaedam et positura
partium, et tanquam villi et fibrae, quae diligenter investi-
gandae sunt; utpote sine quarum inventione corpora illa
commode tractari aut regi non possunt At circulationes

⁴⁹ Mr. Ellis, commenting on the corresponding passage below, says:
‘This passage shows that Bacon was not aware that the poles are not fixed
(collocati) anywhere3 in other words, that he was not acquainted with the
precession of the equinoxes ;-au additional proni how little oi his attention
had been given to matbematieal physice! ln the Historia Ventorum (E.
, and S, vol. ii. p. 28), as Mr. Spedding (employing Mr. Ellis's notes) has
pointed out, be speaks oi the north pole as being above, and the south
pole below us. See lllr. Spedding’s Preiace to the De interpretatione
Naturae Prooemium, vol iii. p. 512.

⁵⁰ ἔκστασις, a displaeement, or a standing aside. We may construe ‘out
oi place! The word is common in Aristotle.

⁶¹ ‘As ultimate laets! Cp. i. 48, with note 73. However far we may
carry our speculations‚ there is always something beyond which is leit
unexplained. And this difficulty the burnan mind, with its restless acti·
vity, attempts, and cannot but attempt, to resolve There must always,
it is true, be some barrier to these efforts, but, unless they were constantly
being made, the mind would become atrophied‚ and human knowledge
would soon be at a standstill.

³² This remark does credit tn Bacon’s sagacity. See note 48 above, on
Laplace's nebular hypothesis. Though‚ oi course, Bacon had not the
slightest suspicion oi such explanations as would now be given, still he

had the penetration to suspect that there must be some explanation
forthcoming.
