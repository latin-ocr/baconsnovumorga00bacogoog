tellectus humanus instar speculi inaequalis ad radios rerum,
quisnam naturam naturae rerum immiscet, eamque distorquet

et inficit. ,

Idola specus⁶¹ sunt idola hominis individui. Habet enim
unusquisque (praeter aberrationes naturae humanae in
genere) specum sive cavernam quandam individuam, quae
lumen naturae frangit et corrumpit: vel propter naturam
cujusque propriam et singularem3 vel propter educationem
et conversationem cum aliis; vel propter lectionem librorum,
et authoritates eorum quos quisque colit et miratur; vel
propter differentias impressionum, prout occurrunt in animo
praeoccupato et praedisposito, aut in animo aequo et sedatu,
vel ejusmodi: ut plane spiritus humanus (prout disponitur
in hominibus singulis) sit res varia, et omnino perturbata, et
quasi Ἥρω. Unde hene Heraclitus, homines scientias

external world, instead of commencing with our own thoughts, and pro·
jecting these, as it were, on the universe. Man must look without and not
within, if he desires to be truly acquainted with the world around him.
This idea is perfectly just, providing we recollect that, after all, we can
never know things as they are in themselves, but only as they appear
to us. The peculiarities of the human mind generally and of the indi·
vidual mind in particular must, after all our precautions, have their share
in determining the form which our knowledge assumes. By what is true,
we mean, in the last analysis, that which alimen might be brought to
acknowledge, if their faculties were in a healthy and vigorous condition,
and if they were supplied with all the materials requisite for forming
a judgment.

Malebranche (Recherche de la verite, livre ii. 2¹ne partie, cha) refers
to these words and the next sentence as ‘fort judicieuses.’

⁵¹ The metaphor is taken from Plato's Mythe of the Cave, at the
opening of the 7th Book of the Republic. But, as is remarked by Sir
W. Hamilton (Reid's Works, p. 473, ra), the metaphorapplies ratberto the
ldola Tribus than to the class of fallacies here described ; for by Plato all
mankind, except the few philosophers who have found their way upwards,
are regarded as being bound in the same cave, and as mistaking the
shadows which pass before them for realities. By hacun, on the other
hand, each man is pictured as dwelling in his own particular cave, and
mistaking his individua] impressione for those of mankind at large.

⁵¹ There is an interesting allusion to the ldola Specus in the Cogi·
tata et Visa (E. and S, vol. iii. p. 607): ‘Quin certissimum esse, tum

generaliter. . . . tum etiam cuique ex educatione, studiis, et natura sua,
