quod Duo corpora nonpossint esse in uno loco,· vel vocat
motum Ne fiat penetratio dimensionum ³⁸. Neque hujus
motus exempla proponi consentaneum est: inest enirn omni

(a) Sit Motus Secundus, Motus (quem appellamus) Ναυῆ
perquem corpora non patiuntur se ulla ex parte sui dirimi a
contactu alterius corporis, ut quae mutuo nexu et contactu
gaudeant. Quem motum Schola vocat Motum Ne detur
vacuum⁵⁹: veluti cum aqua attrahitur sursum exustione, aut
per listulas3 caro per ventosas ⁰⁰; aut curn aqua sistitur nec
effluit in hydriis perforatis, nisi os hydriae ad immittendum
ae'rem aperiatur; et innumera id genus.

(3) Sit Motus Tertius, Motus (quem appellamus) Liber·

⁵⁶ Cp. ii. 36 (6). ll there could be two bodies in one place, one ol them
would he annihilated, which is a contradiction in terms. Hence, both the
axioms here referred to imply the indestructibility of matter.

⁸¹ ln the Phaenomena Universi (E. and S, vol. iii. p. 704) this is called
‘Motus successionis, quern motum ne detur vacuum appellant:

On Bacon's rejection oia vacuum, and his notion os ‘Nature’s abhor-
rence os a vacuum,' cp. i. 66 ad fin, ii. 8 ad init, with the notes on
those passages. Mr. Ellis, in his Prelace to the Historia Densi et Rari
(E. and S., vol. ii. p 238), remarks on the change which Bacon's opinions
seem to have undergone on this subject between writing the Cogitationes
de Rerum Natura and the essay on the lable ol Cupid on the one hand,
and the historia Densi et Rari and the Novum Organum on the other.
ln the ‘Canones' appended to the former ol these two last works
(E. and S., vol. ii. p. 303) he says: ‘Non est vacuum in natura, nec
congregatum nec intermistum.¹ But euriously enough, notwithstanding
other passages in the N ovum Organum to the contrary, he speaks doubt·
sully towards the end of this present Aphorism: ‘Utrum vero motus
nexus sit invincibilis, adhuc haeremus Neque enim pro certo affirma·
verimus, utrum detur vacuum, sive coacervatum, sive permistum.¹ See my
notes on this passage.

⁶⁰ Cupping-glasses. The process ol cupping has been explained in
note 52 on Aph. 35. lt may he remarked oi all the phenomena rderred
to in this section that their explanation depends on a knowledge ol the
laws ol atmospheric pressure. Ol these laws, Bacon was ignorant.

⁸¹ By the ‘Motus Libertatis' Bacon means what in modern Physics
is called Elasticity, a property common to all matter. lt is the property
in virtue ol which bodies resume their original form or volume, when the
