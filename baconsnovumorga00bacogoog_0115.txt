86 INTRODUCTION.

such as Cardan 3ηά Galileo, l have not thought it necessary to
qugffcon’s own criticisms, degenerating often into invectives, will be
sufficiently illustrated from the Novum Organum and the parallel
passages which, from time to time, I shall quote from his other
writings

Taurus the main peculiarities of Bacon’s method and teaching to
have been-(1) the emphasis with which he insisted on the necessity
of consulting and collecting facts, of going straight to Nature, of
instituting observations and experiments before formulating general
propositions; (a) the gradual aseent from propositions or axioms of
a lower to those of a higher degree of generality ; (3) the selection
and comparison of instances in place of the old Inductio per Enume-
rationem Simplicem ; (4) the disregard of Authority 3 3ηά (5) the
restraint of Fancy: we may proceed to enquire how far, in these and
other less important or more detailed parts of his system, be was
anticipated by preceding writers. Now, it must be confessed at
once that, in many of these respects, the method of Bacon is to be
found embodied in the teaching and example of Aristotle, 3ηά even
of Socrates and Plato. Induction of some sort or other, and, con·
sequently, the examination 3ηά collection of facts, is as old as
human reasoning. This object gave me pleasure or pain yesterday,
and, therefore, 1 will pursue or avoid 3 similar object today ; or l
compassed my ends in this way yesterday, and, therefore, l will try
a similar mode again today, are amongst the earliest thoughts which
· would occur to man. It is, therefore, of course, absurd to represent
Bacon as the author or discoverer of Induction. What logicians ⁹
have done is not to invent forms of reasoning, but to analyse,
criticise‚ and offer rules and cautions for securing the due perform-
ance of those which already exist. Hence, it would be utterly
superfluous to accumulate early instances of inductive reasoning3
as respects my present purpose, it is quite sufficient to refer to the
ἐπακτικοὶ λόγοι or παραβολὴ of Socrates ¹, and to give a very brief

¹ On this mode of reasoning and on Plato's method of Exclusions, see my note
on Now. Org. bia i. aph. 105.
