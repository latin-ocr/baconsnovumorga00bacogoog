Posito itaque doctrinae scopo, pergendum ad praecepta;
idque ordine minime perverso aut perturbato. Atque indicia
de interpretatione naturae complectuntur partes in genere
duas ⁵⁶: primam, de educendis aut excitandis axiomatibus ab
experientia; secundam, de deducendis aut derivandis experi-
mentis novis ab axiomatibus. Prior autem trifariam dividi-

use of the word ‘Metaphysie' The word, as l bave already pointed
out (Bk. i. Aph. 63. n. 31), originated as a designation of a certain
collection of Aristotelian treatises (τὰ μετὰ τὰ φυσικά), which was
regarded by those who arranged Aristotle’s works as a sort of appendix
to the Physics. On the various and often contradictory meanings which
it has subsequently borne, it would be beside my purpose to speak. In
the ordinary sense of the tenn, Bacon did not recognise Metaphysics as
a science distinct from Physics, on the one side, and Natural Theology,
on the other. See Introduction, p. 67, and cp. pp. 15, 16.

⁶⁴ ln this Apborism, it would be difficult to say whether ‘forms’ are
used in the sense of ‘lawa’ or ‘essences’ Bacon probably had no clear
perception of the distinction between the two ideas.

ω Cp. De Augmentis, iii. 5, which will fumish a full explanation of this
passage.

Μ Namely, Induction and Deduction. On the latter method, the
Novum Organum, in its fragmentary state, contains nothing (unless, we
except the instances mentioned in ii. 52, as conducing ‘ad operativam'),
though the seventh, nintb, and possibly fourth parts (see Aph. 21) were
to deal with this subject.

M. Bouillet remarks that, in the Partis Secundae Delineatio, the Pars
Activa is distinguished from the Deductive branch of the Pars Contem-
plativa, whereas here the two are spoken of as one. See E. and S., vol iii.
pp. 556-7. Μ. Bouillet also remarks that it is doubtful whether Bacon
would have found in the practical or operativa part sufficient matter for
a special treatise, bearing in mind what he himself says: ‘inter contem·
plativam partem activam perpetuo intercurrere' (Partis Secundae Deli-
neatio, E. and S, vol. iii. p. 556).
