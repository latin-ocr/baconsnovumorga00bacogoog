BACON’S INFLUENCE ΟΝ SCIENCE. 103

respect sor Bacon, but that he regarded his works as a real contri·
bution to scientific method'¹.

Gassendi (who was, in many respectS, a precursor ol Loclre, and
whom that philosopher appears to have carelully studied) gives in his
book De logicae Origine et Varietate, cap. ro, a somewhat elaborate
account oi the contents oi the Novum Organum, while, in cap. 11, he
compares it favourably with the logie oi Desoartes. In the book De
Logicae Fine, cap. 6, he recurs to the subject. It is plain that he
sympathises warmly with Bacon’s aims and efforts: ‘Ausu vere
Heroico novam tentare viam est ausus, sperareque iore ut, modo illi
strenue diligenterque insistatur, nova tandem eaque perlecta condi
haberique Philosophia possit! Descartes is spoken of as imitating
Bacon in the destructive part os his method, and praised accordingly.
But, in the constructive parts, their methods diverged as widely as
could be: ‘Non eandem tamen viam est quam Verulamius ingressus3
sed curn Verulamius auxilia a rebus ad perficiendam Intellectus cogi·
tationem petierit, ipse, omni rerum cogitatione ablegata, censuit in
ipsa cogitatione satis esse praesidii, ut Intellectus possit vi sua in
omniurn rerum etiam abstrusissimarum, hoc est non modo corporum,
sed Dei etiam ac Animae, notitiam perlectam venire!

‘In another work’ (1 here quote lrom Mr. Macvey Napier), ‘his
valuable account ot' his celebrated friend Peiresc [contained in vol. v.
oi Gassendi's works], there is a passage in which Bacon is mentioned
in a way particularly deserving os notice in the present discussion
“No man,'' says Gassendi, speaking ol his friend, “made more
observations, or caused more to be made, to the end that at last
some notioris os natural things, more sound and pure than those
commonly received, might be collected; ior which reason he admired
the genius, and approved the design ol that great chancellor ol

¹¹ lu M. Baillet's Life ol' Descartes (published at Paris in 1691), part i. pp. 147-
149, we are told ol the regret oi Descnrtes and others at hearing ol Bacon's desthz
‘Cette nouvelle touchrr sensiblement oeux qni aspiroient apres le retabliasement de
la veritable philosophie, et qui scavoient que Bacon trevallloit d ce grand dessein
depuis plusieurs anates! 'l'he author then proceeds to contrsst the graudeur ol his
denigo with the slendemess ol his performanoe, aud, like ι true disciple‚ says that
the execution ol a design so heroic was reserved lor a genius still more extra·
ordinary. Ol the actual performnnce ln the Novum organum he speaks dis
peragingly: ‘Mais ce n‘etoit qu'un essay deses sublimes projets, capable seule·
ment de laisser dans l’esprit de ses lecteurs une idee eds-grande de ce qu’il laisolt
espe‘rer a la ponente. nussi voyons nous qu'il n'y approlondit rien ς que les pro· Ἴ
positious et les axiomes qu'il y avauce sont plutdt des avis et des expediens pour
donner des ouvertmesa mediter, que des maximes propres d etabllr des principes*
Bayle, in his meagre account ol Bacon, refers to this work.
