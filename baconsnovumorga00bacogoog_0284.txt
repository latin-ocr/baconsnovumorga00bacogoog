had a similar effect in leading men to despair of the possibility ol lrnow·
ledge. To this characteristic Bacon here alludes in the words, ‘primo
tanquam per jocum et ironiam,' &e The object ol Socrates, however,
was not to induce scepticism, but to purily the mind lrom all pre-conceived
opinions, in order to prepare it sor the more impartial investigation oi
truth. Lastly, Plato had spared no pains in demolishing the general belief
in the trustworthiuess and acctrracy of sense-knowledge, in order to rear
on its ruins his theory oi ideas. This doctrine, in its turn, had been
severely criticised, and, in the opinion oi many, reiuted by Aristotle.
Hence, we cannot be surprised ir to some there seemed to be no way out
of the dialectical puzzles and subtleties by which the question ol the
reality oi knowledge was perplexed. The solution ol these difficulties
offered by the philosophare oi the New Academy, in their ascending grades
oi probability, has been already given in note 4} on Aph. 37.

In the De Augmentis, lib. i. (E. and S, vol. i. p. 462), Bacon couples the
name ol Socrates with that ol the [New] Academy: ‘Non negaverim in
summariis libellis ad praxim destinatis hanc farinulam scribendi retineri
posse, verum injustis tractatibus de scientiis utrumque extremum vitandum
censeo, tam Velleii Epicurei, nil tam metuentis quam ne dubitare de re
aliqua videretur, quarn Socratis et Academiae omnia in dubio relinquen·
tium! The allusion to Velleius, the Epicurean, is borrowed irom Cicero,
De Natura Deorum, lib. i. cap. 8: ‘Tum Velleius, fidenter sane, ut solent
isti, nihil tam verens, quarn ne dubitare aliqua de re videretur: tanquam

· modo ex deorum concilio etex Epicuri intermundiis descendisset! In

this Aphorism there is no allusion to Velleius by name, but a portion ol the
passage in the De Natura Deorum is incorporated in the text.

‘³ The positive and dogmatic characteres the old Sophists is well illus·
trated in the rst book oi Plato's Republic, in the person ol Thrasymachus,
who, however, must be regarded as a caricature. The English reader rnay
be referred, on the subject oi tbe Sophiste, to Mr. Lewes' History ol
Philosophy, Grote's chapter on the Sophists in his History oi Greece and
his work on Plato throughout, Sir Alexander Grant’s second Essay prefixed
to his edition oi Aristotle’s Ethies, and Mr. Henry Sidgwick's papers in the
Journal of Philology.

‘⁴ For these grades ot probability, see note 41 on Aph. 37. On the
distinctions, real or supposed, between the doctrines ol the New Academy
and the Sceptics proper, see the same note. The school ol Pyrrho (osten
called Pyrrhonists as wellas Sceptics) was prior to that oi the New
