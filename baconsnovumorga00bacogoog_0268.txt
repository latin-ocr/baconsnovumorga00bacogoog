ΜΒ. Ι. 61-62. 239

ut linea recta fiat, aut circulus perfectus describatur, multum
est in constantia et exercitatione manus, si fiat ex vi manus
propria, sin autem adhibeatur regula, aut circinus, parum aut
nihil; omnino similis est nostra ratio. Licet autem consuta-
tionum particularium nullus sit usus, de sectis tamen et
generibus hujusmodi theoriarum nonnihil dicendum est3
atque etiam paulo post de signis exterioribus, quod se male
habeant3 et postremo de causis tantae infelicitatis et tam
diuturni et generalis in errore consensus; ut ad vera minus
difficilis sit aditus, et intellectus humanus volentius expurgetur
et idola dimittat.

Idola¹ theatri, sive theoriarum‚ multa sunt, et multo plura
esse possunt, et aliquando fortasse erunt. Nisi enim per
multa jam saecula hominum ingenia circa religionem et
theologiam occupata fuissent3 atque etiarn politiae civiles
(praesertim monarchiae) ab istiusmodi novitatibus etiam in con-
templationibus, essent aversae ; ut cum periculo et detrimento
fortunarum suarum in illas homines incumbant, non solum
praemio destituti, sed etiam contemptui et invidiae expositi:
complures aliae proculdubio philosophiarum et theoriarum

Chillingworth‚ and that all the readers oi his Rhetoric would speak like
Burke. That Bacon was altogether mistaken as to this point will now
hardly be disputed. His philosophy has flourished during two hundred
years, and has produced none oi this levelling. The interval between a
man of talents and a dunce is as wide as ever; and is never more clearly
discemible than when they engage in researches which require the con·
stant use of induction’

Bacon's promise never has been, and never can be, iulfilled. ln the
lnductive Sciences, there is the same scope sor the play of the Imagination,
lor the work os the creative and inventive faculty, as in Art or Poetry;
and there is at least ¹as much occasion t'or acuteness and rapidity os
reasoning as in what are called the exact sciences. The greatest dis-
coveries in science have always been made by men with a keen perception
of the analogies of nature, and, consequently, with an aptitude ior traming
bold, and, at the same time, just hypotheses. The study os scientific

‘ method may, and, l believe, does, strengthen and cultivate a man's ori·

ginal powers, but it ean never create them or supply their place. It must
not be iorgotten, however, that, in the work oi science, even the humblest
intellect can do good service in the way of collecting and arranging materials
ior subsequent investigation.

1 shall recur to this topic in a note on the parallel passage in Aph. 122.
