est, postquam Christiana tides recepta luisset et adolevisset,
longe maximam ingeniorum praestantissimorum partem ad
theologiam se contulisse3 atque huic rei et amplissima
praemia proposita, et omnis generis adjumenta copiosissime
subministrata fuisse: atque hoc theologiae studium praecipue
occupasse tertiam illam partem sive periodum temporis apud
nos Europaeos occidentales; eo magis, quod sub idem sere
tempus et literae florere, et controversiae circa religionem
pullulare coeperint. At aevo superiori, durante periodo illa
secunda apud Romanos, potissimae philosophorum medita-
tiones et industriae in morali philosophia (quae ethnicis vice

Learning, the account ol the respective iunctione ol the Philosophia Prima
and Natural Philosophy is substantially the same as that in the De Aug·
mentis. Cp. also Bk. i. Aph. 127 oi the Novum Organum. One can
hardly avoid the conclusion that, in the Aphorisms now under discussion,
Bacon has consuunded the conception oi Natural Philosophy with that ol
the Philosophia Prima

This difficulty having been pointed out, the subsequent notes to these
two Aphorisms must be regarded as applying to Natural Philosophy only
as bere understood.

”⁰ In the corresponding passage oi the Cogitata et Visa, Gruter, though
not the Queen’s College Ms, reads ‘quae Ethnicis, magna ex parte, vice
Theologiae erat.¹

The Greek and Roman religious contained little theology in our sense
oi the term. They recognised no creeds, catechism, or articles oi saith.
Nor were the priests oi the classical religions, like ours, moral and
religious teachers. The religion was mainly a cult, and the priests were
almost exclusively the performers os rites and sacrifices. Into a man’s
religious convictions, so long as he kept the required religious obser·
vances, lew cared to enquire. Nor, again, though certain crimes, such as
homicide, the refusal oi hospitality, the breach of an nath, the removal ol
a boundary, dcc, were supposed to be avenged by certain deities, was there
any definite and detailed connexion between the religion and the morality
oi dassical times. Os the divorce between the popular religion and what
we understand by morality, we cannot have better examples than those
adduced by Plato in the 2nd and 3rd Books of the Republic.

Hence, it naturally happened that the discussions as to the nature of
the Gods and the grounds and precepts of morality t'ell into the hands
of the philosophers. Tbeology, as treated by them, assumed a meta-
physical character, having little orno practical bearing on the affairs oi
lile (witness the discussions in the so-called ‘ Metaphysics' oi Aristode),
and, consequently, possessed no attractions for ordinary men. The belief
or disbeliei in the propositione maintained by the philosophers was not
