Gravitation were arrived at very nearly in this exact order. To
these considerations I may add that the method proposed by Baoon
has met with the approval oi no less distinguished an authority than
Dr. Whewell ⁵⁸. ’

With reference to the ‘Tables ³ which occupy the beginning os the
Second Book, it must be acknowledged that, however interesting they
may be in the history os Logic‚ and however much they may have con-
tributed to the precise sonnulation os inductive reasoning, they are only
nrde and imperfect anticipations os the more refined and conclusive
‘Canons os Induction' which we find in the works os Sir John
Herschel, Mr. Mill, and later logicians. Hence, this is a part oi
Bacon’s Logic which is notos much intrinsic value to a student who
is already familiar with recent treatises. To this consideration
it may be added that the reasoning throughout this part of the
Novum Organum is rendered more or less vague and obscure by
the employment of the term ‘Fonn,' instead of the more precise
expressions, such as law, Cause, Conditions, dre, by which it is
now replaced.

Of far more intrinsic value to the modern student, as it seems to
me, are some of the ‘Praerogativae Instantiarum.' Many os the
expressions employed lor the purpose os designating theru still form
part os our logical tenuinology, and it would be very difficolt, in
many cases to describe, moreaptlyand precisely than Bacon does, the
nature os the reasoning involved in these ‘aids ol the understanding.
The scientific examples are, generally, sar too numerous, and (not-
withstanding the value or interest attaching to some of them) are
osten wrongly stated, trivial, or inappropriate‚ but it appears to me
that less attention than it deserves has been paid to the logical
matter contained in this part of Bacon's work.

The relation os Observation to Experiment and oi both to the ·

more purely rational process ol Induction, is well conceived and
stated by Bacon.

To the doctrine of Fallacies, or ‘Idola’ l have already alluded
under the first, or more general head, though it might also well be

taken into account in drawing upa list os the special logical doctrines
which are of intrinsic value to the modern student.

It will be seen that I am inclined to attribute to Bacon’s logical
mles and maxims much more intrinsic value, even lor the purposes
