jectum instantia crucis talis; quod lamina, aut filum lerri
paulo contumacius, vel etiam calamus sive penna in medio
divisa, adducta et curvata inter pollicem et digitum, exiliant.
Manifestum enim est, hoc non posse imputari aeri sepone
corpus colligenti, quia lons motus est in medio laminae vel
calami, non in extremis ¹⁸.

(7) Similiter sit natura inquisita motus ille rapidus et
potens Expansionis Pulveris Pyrii in flammam ¹⁹3 unde tantae
moles subvertuntur, tanta pondera emittuntur, quanta in cuni·
culis majoribus et bombardis videmus Bivium circa hanc
naturam tale est. Aut excitatur iste motus a mero corporis
appetitu se dilatandi, postquam luerit inflammatum aut ab
appetitu mixto spiritus crudi, qui rapide fugit ignem, et ex eo
circumfuso, tanquam ex carcere, violenter erumpit . Schola
autem et vulgaris opinio tantum versatur circa priorem illum
appetitum. Putant enim homines se pulchre philosophari, si
asserant flammam ex forma elementi necessitate quadam

²⁸ He seems here, notwithstanding having drawn the distinction above,
to mistake the question at issue, which was not as to the origin ol the
motion os a projectile, but as to its continuance. And even ir his instance
were to the point, it would only be decisive against the one theory, not
in savour of the other.

ln the Cogitationes De Natura Rerum, cap. 8 (E. and S., vol. iii. pp.
28-31), he treats this subject at greater length and adds other experiments,
which are, however, no more decisive than the one given here.

¹⁹ This question is also treated in the Cogitationes De Natura Rerum.
See cap. 9. Bacon's solution of the difficulty by referring the explosion to
the ‘conflict ol two bodies: and his language about the ‘unde spirit which
is in nitre,’ are thoroughly characteristic both ol his own chemical views
and, generally, ol those ol his time. Chemistry, we must recollect, had
hardly as yet put on a scientific form, and,1noreover, it was peculiarly
encumbered by the use ol a lancilul and metaphorical language.

As to the true explanationes the great explosive power of gunpowder, it
‘is due to the sudden development ol a large volume of gaseous bodies,
chieflyconsistiug of nitrogcnandcarbonicanhydride,which‚at the ordinary
temperature ol the air, would occupy a space equal to about 300 times the
bulk or' the powder used; but, from the intense heat developed at the
moment of the explosion, the dilation amounts to at least 500 times
the volume of the gunpowder employed! Miller's Elements oi Chemistry‚
Part ii. pp. 399-400. The principle ol this explanation was first demon-
strated by Jean Bernoulli See Hoeser, Histoire de la Chimie, tome ii.

pp. 264-265.
