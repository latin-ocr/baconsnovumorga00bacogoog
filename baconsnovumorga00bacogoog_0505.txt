(see, for instance, De Augmentis, iii. 4), depreciates the importance of
mathematical calculationis as applied to tbe motions of the heavenly bodies
And yet, without the aid of mathematics, where would bave been the
modern science of Astronomy? The simultaneous discovery of the planet
Neptune by Adams and Le Verrier, as a result of the most elaborate
mathematical investigations (to say nothing of the more familiar case of
the prediction of eclipses), is alone a sufficient refutation of Bacon's view.
F ormal Astronomy, or the consideration of the apparent motions of the
heavenly bodies in Space and Time, was an essential prelude to Physical
Astronomy, or the reference of these motions to their causes in Foroe
and Matter. But, though Bacon went too far in depreciating F omrai
Astmnomy‚ we must not forget that he was oue of the first to point out '
the importante of Physical Astronomy, as well as of establishing a closer ¹
union between both branches of the science: ‘Quamobrem hanc partem

'² The distinction of higher and lower comets may be found in Seneca,
Nat. Quaest. vii. 6, 7, and is there referred to Epigenes. Bacon, in the
De Fluxu et Refluxu Maris (E. and S, vol. iii. p. 53), speaks of the ‘lower
comets’ as being lower than tbe orb of the moon. By many ancient philo-
sophers, all comets were regarded as sublunar. lt is needless to remark
that, on the other hand, all true comets belong to the solar, and not to the
terrestrial system. In reading ancient authors, however, it must always
be borne in mind that they often designated mere atmospheric meteors
by the name of comets.
⁰⁸ Whereas the planets and their satellites, with the sole known excep
tion of the satellites of Uranus, revolve with what is called adr'rect motion,
that is, from W. to E, the comete seem to be almost equallydivided
between those which have a direct motion, from W. to E, and those which
have a retrograde motion, from E. to W. But what Bacon desiderated vas
a comet whose proper motion from W. to E. more than compensated for
