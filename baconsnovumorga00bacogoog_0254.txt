LIB. I. 49. 225

quemadmodum inveniuntur, neque sunt revera causabilia3
tamen intellectus humanus, nescius acquiescere, adhuc appetit
notiora ⁷⁴. Tum vero, ad ulteriora tendens, ad proximiora
recidit, videlicet ad causas finales ⁷⁵, quae sunt plane ex

natura hominis, potius quam universi: atque ex hoc sonte
philosophiam miris modis corruperunt. Est autem aeque
imperiti et leviter philosophantis, in maxime universalibus
causam requirere, ac in subordinatis et subalternis ⁷⁶ causam

non desiderare.

intellectus humanus luminis sicci non est⁷⁷; sed recipit

sonus are themselves, as a matter oi sact, due to no other cause, but what
he does probably mean is that it is in vain sor usto inquire into their
cause; to us they are and must be ultimate sactS, to be taken sor granted,
and it is mere idle speculation to try and trace the course of nature
beyond them. Cp. with this passage, Il. 48 (14), and specially De
Augmentis, lib. ix. (E. and S, vol. i. p. 833. l. 10, etc.) See also lntro·
duction, p. 63.

The word ‘positiva' may be translated ‘absolute' or ‘ultimate' lt
seems intended to express the opposite ol ‘relative’ or ‘dependent'
that is, relative to or dependent on other causes. These laets are ‘to
be taken for granted‘ instead oi ‘to be explained!

⁷⁴ That is, natura notiora or ‘still more general laws.'

⁷⁶ F or the meaning os the expression ‘Final Causes,’ the reader may
refer to the first ioot-note on § 8 oi the Introduction, and, ior Bacon’s
criticism oi the doctrine, to 6 10.

Man projects his own aims and ideas on the Universe, and regards
God or Nature as acting in the same way in which he would act him·
seli. Thus, instead oi accommodating his thoughts to Nature, he accom-
modates Nature to his own thoughts. Compare what is said by one oi the
interlocutors in Galileo’s Third Dialogus: ‘Great, in my judgment, is the
iolly oi those who would have had God to have made the World more
proportional to the narrow capacities of their reason, than to his immense,
yea infinite power! (Sir Thomas Salusbury's Translation, p. 335.)

⁷⁰ A logical term, denoting particular propositions in relation to their
corresponding universals Thus, SomeX isY is ‘subaltem’ to All X is Y.

Mr. Ellis very appropriately quotes Arist. Metaph. iii. 4 (1006 a. 6-9).
ἔστιγὰρ ἀπαιδευσία τὸ μὴ γιγνώσκειν τίνων δεῖ ζητεῖν ἀπόδειξιν rol τίνων οὗ δεῖ.
ὅλων μὲν γὰρ ἁπάντων ἀδύνατον ἀπόδειξιν εἶναι· εἷς ἄπειρον γὰρ dv βαδίζοι, ὥστε
μηδ’ οὕτως εἶναι ἀπόδειξιν.

rr Compare the osten-quoted maxim of Heraclitus; αὕη ξηρὴ ψυχὴ
Δσοφωτάτη or an, ψυχὴ σοφωτάτῃ καὶ ἀρίστη. The authorities for these
maxims are given in Ritter and Preller’s Historia Philosophiae, and ed,
p. 26.
