ComIng to the second'class of passages, in which the conception of
‘law’ predominates, we find that they are founded on the scholastic,
or rather Aristotelian, distinction of potentia and actus, afwapnand
ὲιέργεια. As this distinction is explained in the notes on i. 51, I may
refer the reader, who is not already acquainted with it, to that place.
The ‘form’ is ‘lex actus sive motus,’ ‘lex illa et determinatio actus
puri quae naturam aliquam simplicem ordinat et constituit in omni-
moda materia et subjecto susceptibili! The ‘fonn‚’ then, according
to this mode of representing it, is the law which govems (or, as we
should rather say, expresses) the process by whicha quality (or body)
is developed out of its preexisting conditions. It may be defined
as the law of the development or manifestation or production of any
given quality or body. (Cp. Nov. Org. ΙΙ. 2 5 ad. init.) And, if we
take into account the preexisting conditions as well as the law of
their development, we obtain the conception of ‘cause' in its fullest
extent. We thus see how the word ‘form’ may be replaced by ‘law’
or ‘cause' '

Now, is it possible to reconcile or bring into any connexion these
two apparently divergent meanings? The form, we have seen, is,
according to the one conception, the aggregate of the primary or
underived attributes from which the other attributes are derived, as
eflects from causes. According to the other conception, it is the law
according to which the phenomenon in question is developed out of
praexistingconditions, or, taking into account the conditions, it is, in
brief, its cause. But, practically (and the practical interestis with
Bacon, we must recollect, always supreme), these two conceptions
may, if we take a sufficiently sanguine view of human power, be
regarded as leading to the same result. Given the aggregate of
primary and underived attributes, and the phenomenon follows as a
matter of course. Given the precxisting conditions and the law of
their development, and (on the important assumption that we are
able to further the development of the conditions, that we possess
an ‘efficiens' as a ‘vehiculum formae ²) we are ourselves able to
produce the effect. Thus, the knowledge of the essence (in the
sense which I have attached to that word) and the knowledge of

the cause are, for all practical purposes, the same⁴⁰. If, to take
Bacon’s instances, we know that hear consists in a certain kind of

⁴⁰ To this explanation lt might certainly be obJ'ected that l arn confonnding laws of
coexistence wilh laws of succession. But then, l think, it might be replied that we
must conceive of the secandary or derived qualiries as follorm’ng on the collocation of
the primary or underived qualitles, even though the rime occupied be infinitesimal.
