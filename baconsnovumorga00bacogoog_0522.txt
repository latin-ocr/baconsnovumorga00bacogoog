T hough Galileo was not the actual inventor of the Telescope‚ he seems
to have been the first who turned it to scientific uses, and it was, uu·
doubtedly, through his discoveries by means of it that it first became
celebrated. Fora long time, also, the best telescopes were only to be
procured from Galileo or his scholars. The first telescope constructed by
him was presented to the Doge of Venice in 1609.

‘⁸ ‘Compare this passage with that in the Descriptio Globi Intellectualis
(c. v.), where Bacon speaks of Galileo's invention and discoveries (the first·
fruits of which bad just been announced) ina strain of more sanguine
expectatioo: “Atque hoc inceptum et tine et aggressu nobile quoddam et
humano genere dignum esse existimamus: eo magis quod hujusmodi ho·
mines et ausu laudandi sint et fide; qubd ingenue et perspicue propo·
suerunt, quomodo singula illis constiterint. Superest tantum constantia,
curn magna judicii severitate, ut et instrumenta mutent, et testium nume·
rum augeant, et singula et saepe experiantur, et varie; denique ut et sibi
ipsi objiciant et aliis patefaciant quid in contrarium objici possit, et tenuis·
simum quemque scrupulum non spernant; ne forte illis eveniat, quod
Democrito et aniculae suae evenit circa licus mellitas, ut vetula esset philo·
sopho prudentior, et magnae et admirabilis speculationis causae subesset
error quispiam tenuis et ridiculus.’' From tbis passage, written eight years
before, we may learn (Ι think) why it was that Bacon had now begun to
doubt how far these observations could be trusted. Believing, as he did, ·
that all the received theories of the heavens were full of error, as soon as
he heard that by means of the telescope men could really see so much
further into the heavens than before, he was prepared to hear of a great
number of new and unexpected phenomena; and his only fear was that
the observers, instead of following out their observations patiently and
carefully, would begin to form new theories But now that nine years had
passed since the discovery of Jupiter's satellites the spots in the sun, ἂι,
and no new discovery of importante had been announced, he wondered
how it could be that men seeing so much funher should be ableto see so
little more than they did, and began to suspect that it was owing to some
defect either in the instrument or iu the methods of observation! This
note 1 have borrowed from Mr. Spedding.
