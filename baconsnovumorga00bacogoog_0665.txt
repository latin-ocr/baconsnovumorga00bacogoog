motus communi et inveterata opinione habetur pro proprio
coelestium. Attamen gravis de illo motu lis est inter oon·
nullos tam ex antiquis quam modernis, qui rotationem terrae
attribuerunt. At multo sortasse justior⁶⁰ movetur controversia
(si modo res non sit omnino extra controversiam), an motus

videlicet iste (concesso quod terra stet) coeli finibus conti-
neatur, an potius descendat, et communicetur aeri et aquis ⁸¹.
Motum autem rotatrhm's in missilibus, ut in spiculis, sagittis,
pilis sclopetorum, et similibus, omnino ad motum libertatis
rejicimus ⁶².

(18) Sit Motus Decimus Octavus, Motus T repidatrhm's, cui
(ut ab astronomis intelligitur) non multum fidei adhibemus ⁶³.
Nobis autem corporum naturalium appetitus ubique serio
perscrutantibus occurrit iste motus; et constitui debere videtur
in speciem. Est autem hic motus veluti aeternae cujusdam
captivitatis. Videlicet ubi corpora non omnino pro natura
sua bene locata, et tamen non prorsus male se habentia,

to circular motion, that is, unless we reject the sixth and seventh species
ol variation, it will not be necessary ior us to suppose the poles themselves
to be movable: iu other words, that the phenomena ol which we could
by this hypothesis give an account maybe adequately represented without
it by means oi spirals!

⁶⁰ This language, the reader will perceive, exactly accords with what
we have so often elsewhere iound to be Bacon's opinion not only as to the
annual, but also as to the diumal motion of the earth.

⁸¹ Cp. Aph. 36 (2), and notes.

⁸¹ See ‘Motus tertius’ above, and Aph. 36 (6).

⁸³ ‘The name os trepidation was given by the Alpbonsine astronomers
to a motion by which they imagined the starry heaven to be affected, and
in virtue of which its equinoxes described small circles os nine degrees
radius about those ol the ninth or next superior orb. To account lor this
motion they introduced a tenth orb. The phenomenon, however, thus
accounted sor was altogether imaginary, although it is true that the length
ol the tropical year, by supposed variatione os which the idea of trepi-
tion was suggested, is not rigorously constant. lt may be questioned
whether Bacon’s hesitation to accept the astronomical motion of trepi-
dation had any better foundation than his doubts whether the proper
motions of the planetary orbs were anything more than “res confictae et
suppositae.'' [See Aph. 36 (2).] The question os the existence
or non-existence ol trepidation could only be decided by a person
conversam with the details oi the received system of astronomy.¹ Mr.
Ellis' note.
