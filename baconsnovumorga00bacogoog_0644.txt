perpetuo trepidant, et irrequiete se agant ⁶⁴, nce statu suo
contenta, nec ulterius ausa progredi. Talis invenitur motus
in corde et pulsibus animalium; et necesse est ut sit in
omnibus corporibus, quae statu ancipiti ita degunt inter
commoda et incommoda, ut distracta liberare se tentent, et
denuo repulsam patiantur, ettamen perpetuo experiantur ⁰⁶.
(19) Sit Motus Decimus Nonus et postremus, motus ille cui
vix nomen motus competit, et tamen est plane motus. Quem
motum, Motum Decubitus ⁸⁶, sive Motum Exhorrentiae Motus,
vocare licet. Per hunc motum terra stat mole sua ⁶⁷, mo-
ventibus se extremis suis in medium3 nou ad centrum

⁸⁴ The word ‘agant,' which occurs iu the First Edition, should be
replaced by ‘agunt,’ as is done in the Second and Third Editions.

‘³ Cp. Historia Densi et Ran', E. and S., vol. ii. p. 263: ‘Pulsus cordis
et arteriarum in animalibus fit per irrequietum dilatationem spirituum, et
receptum ipsorum, per vices! ln reading vague aud fancilul passages like
these, we must recollect that Harvey did not begin to teach his theory ol
the circulation os the blood till 1619, and that it was not till 1628 that his
great croatiae, the ‘Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis iu
Animalibus,’ was published. Bacon might, it is true, have derived more
precise views thau those which he expresses from earlier writers, but there
was nothing specially to direct his attention to this subject.

The Tides and the astronomical phenomena of Nutatiou and Libration
mightt'urnish appropriate instances of the ‘Motus Trepidationis.’

‘⁸ Decubitus=lying away from, sc. motion. See F acciolati on decubo.
lle quotes Fabius Pictor apud Aul. Gell. lib. x. cap. 15: ‘Pedes lecti, in
quo cubat [sc. Flamen Dialis], luto tenui circumlitos esse oportet: et de
eo lecto trinoctium continuum non decubat: neque in eo lecto cubare
alium las est.' Decubitus might, however, simply mean ‘lyiug down,'
‘reclining‚’ ‘reposo' (Cp. decumbo.)

On Bacon's vague and improper use ol the word ‘mutium' see the first
note on this Aphorism. Here it cannot be rendered even by ‘process' or
‘operation’ but we must resort to some word oi very wide meaning, such
as ‘tendeucy’ or ‘affection’ ol matter.

‘luertia,' the property ol which Bacon here speaks, is simply the inca·
pacity ol matter to change its own state of rest or motion. The obscure
notions ol Bacon and his contemporaries about motion prevented them
from seeing that this property applies as much to the tendeucy oi a body
in motion to go on moving as to that of a body at rest to remain at rest.
Fora briel account of the establishment ol the First law oi hlotion (which
seems to have been first enunciated by Galileo in 1638), see Wbewell's
History ol the Inductive Sciences, vol. ii. bk. vi. ch. 2.

⁸⁷ Bacon seems never weary ol parading his belief iu the immobility ol
theearth.
