maticum ⁰⁰, ut quae eidam tartr'o aequalia snat etiam inter se
sint aequalia, conforme est cum fabrica syllogismi in logica,
qui unit eaquae conveniunt in medio ¹. Denique multum
utilis est in quamplurimis sagacitas quaedam in conquirendis
et indagandis conformitatibus et similitudinibus physicis.

Inter praerogativas instantiarum, ponemus septimo loco
instantias Monodaas23 quas etiam irregulares sive Hetere-
clitas (sumpto vocabulo a grammaticis) appellare consuevi-
mus. Eae sunt, quae ostendunt corpora in concreto, quae
videntur esse extravagantia 'et quasi abrupta iu natura, et
minime convenire cum aliis rebus ejusdem generis. Etenim
instantiae conformes sunt similes alterius, at instantiae mano-

⁹⁰ Generally, and more properly called an Axiom.

¹ ‘Quae in eodem tertio conveniunt, et inter se conveniunt, regula est
itidem ex Mathematicis; verum simul tam potens in Logica, ut syllogismi
sit fundamentum.⁹ De Augm. iii. 1. There, and in the corresponding
passage ol the Advancement ot' Learning, several other examples of these
‘Axioms' are given.

The Mathematical Axiotn that ‘things which are equal to the same
thing are equal to one another' is, strictly speaking, only applicabis to
Logic, ii we quantity the predicate. But the dictum de omni et nullo,
the maxim ‘nota notae est nota rei ipsius,' and syllogistic principles
such as the ‘Canon oi Reasoning in the First Figure’ which l have given
in my Deductive Logic (9th Ed, p. 94), arc analogous (⁸ conformia ⁹) to it.
ln the passage in the text, this is all that bacon's language implies.

'Ibe later examples in this Aphorism supply another illustration oi
i.127. Cp. Aphs 26, 35.

²Properly ‘monadicas’ See note on i. 45. ln the edition of the
Novum Organum‚ published at Amsterdam in1660,‘monadica' is read
throughout the Second Book, though, curiously, the correction is not
made in the First Book.

Comets, Double Stars, the occasional crescent-shape ol Venus, oi Mer-
cury, and oi the Moon, Eartbquakes, Volcanoes, Cyclones, Meteoric Stones‚
the peculiarities in the relation between the expansion and temperature ol
water as well as os bismuth aud the casting-metals generally, are all good
examples os what Bacon means by these instances. Similarly, in law,
we might adduce as ‘monadic instances' Gavelkind and Borough English,
or, in moral sentiment, Suttee‚ Duelling‚ the Ievirate, dae. lt is some·
times indifferent whether we refer an example to this head or the next
oi instantiae Deviantes, as is the osse with one or two oi the examples
given above.
