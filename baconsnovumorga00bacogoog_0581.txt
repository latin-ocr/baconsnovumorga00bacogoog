*¹ Cp. the very interesting passages on the motion and velocity os Sormd κ
in Sylva Sylvarum, Exps. aoy—1 1, where Bacon proposes an expes-iment lor j
the purpose oi determining the rate at which sound moves. ln principle, ,
the experiment, which oonsists in comparing the time oi seeing a light with
that oi hearing a sound, is the same as that from which the velocity-of
sound bas been actually ascertained. This in dry air andat 0⁹ C is ahorn
1093it. in a second.

There are many stories of the distantes at which sounds have been
heard. The firing at Waterloo is said to have been heard at Dover, and
sometimes the reports ol oannon or volcanoes are said to have been carried
distances¹ os 200, or even 30⁰ miles.

³³ This incapacity is due partly to the colour nithe hall (for we do seea
rocket), partly to the lact that the eye cannot adJust itsell with sufficient
rapidity to its constantly changing positions.

Note again, in the language oi the next sentence, the traces oi the old
theory of ‘ sensible species! Cp. Aph. 43 and note 99.

⁰¹ lt is almost needless to say that this ‘dubitatio plane monstrosa' has
been amply justified. ‘Tm measurement oi the Velocity ol light: says
Professor Playiair, ‘and the wonderful consequences arising from it, are
the best commentaries on this passage, and the highest eulogy on its
Author!

. Taking the velocity os light at 190,000 miles a second, it requires
8¹¹² 18⁸ to traverse a semi-diameter oi the earth’s orbit. From this datum
it is calculated that the light which the very nemest tired stan send us
