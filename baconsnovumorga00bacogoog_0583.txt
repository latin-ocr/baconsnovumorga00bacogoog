Atque hoc, cum similibus, nobis quandoque dubitationem
peperit plane monstrosam ³⁴: videlicet, utrum coeli sereni

³¹ Cp. the very interesting passages oo the motion and velocity ol Souod
in Sylva Sylvarum, Exps. 207-11, where Bacon proposes an experiment lor
the purpose ol determining the rate at which sound moves. ln principle
the experiment, which consists in comparing the time ol seeing a light with
that ol hearinga sound‚ is the same as that from which the velociry ol
sound has been actually ascertained. This in dry air and at 0⁹ C. is about
1093lt. in a second.

There are many stories ol the distances at which sounds have been
heard. The firing at Waterloo is said to have been heard at Dover, and
sometimes the reports oi cannon or volcanoes are said to have been carried
distances' ol 200, or even 300 miles.

³³ This incapacity is due partly to the colour of the hall (lor ve do sees
rocket), partly to the lact that the eye cannot adjust itsell with sufficient
rapidity to its constantly changing positions.

Note again, in the language ol the next sentence, the traces ol the old
theory of ‘ sensible species! Cp. Aph. 43 and note 99.

⁰⁴ lt is almost needless to say that this ‘dubitatio plane monstrosa' has
been amply justified. ‘The measurement ol the Velocity ol light' says
Professor Playlair, ‘and the wonderlul consequences arising honr it, are
the best commentaries on this passage, and the highest eulogy on its
nuthor!

. Taking the velocity ol light at 190,000 miles a second, it requires
8¹¹¹ 18⁸ to traverse a semi-diameter ot the earth's orbit. From this datum
it is calculated that the light which the very nearest rixed stus send us
