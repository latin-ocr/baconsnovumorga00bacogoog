sumptionem: nihil fere ad condensationem et intenerationem ¹⁰,
nisi per misturas et modos quasi spurios. Quare Instantiae
Frigoris omni diligentia sunt conquirendae: quales videntur
inveniri in expositione corporum super turres quando gelat
acriter; in cavernis subterraneis; circundationibus nivis et
glaciei in locis profundioribus, etad hoc excavatis; demis-
sione corporum in puteos; sepulturis corporum in argento
vivo et metallis; immersione corporum in aquis, quae vertunt
ligna in lapides; defossione corporum in terra (qualis fertur
apud Chinenses esse confectio porcellanae ¹¹, ubi massae ad hoc
factae dicuntur manere intra terram per quadraginta aut quin-
quaginta annos, et transmitti ad haeredes, tanquam minerae

¹⁰ This word is opposed to desiccationem. It is another of the numerous
words employed by Bacon, which are not found in classical Latin. Nor
is it recognised by Du Cange.

¹¹ Cp. Historia Densi et Rari, E. and S.‚ vol. ii. p. 295 t N ew Atlantis,
E. and S.‚ vol. iii. p. 157. Mr. Ellis refers to Marco Polo, ii. 77. In
Marsden’s Translation of Marco Polo (London, 1818), the passage runs as
follows: ‘They collect a certain kind of earth, as it were from a mine,
and, laying it in a great heap, suffer it to he exposed to the wind, the rain,
and the sun, for thirty or forty years, during which tinne it is never dis·
turbed. By this it becomes refined and fit for being wrought into the
vessels above mentioned. Such colours as may be thought proper are
then laid on, and the ware is afterwards balred in ovens or fumaces.
Those persons therefore who cause the earth to be dug, collect it for their
children or grandchildren! For the original, see Ramusio’s Collection:
‘Navigationi et Viaggi‚’ vol. ii. p. 49. The chapter is there numbered
as 79.

From the general resemblance between what Bacon says and the pas-
sage in Marco Polo, l can entertain little doubt that he had read it, or
some account talren from it. But, on the main point, it will be seen, the
passages are discordant

One of the numerous derivations of porcelain is the oddone ‘pour cent
anne'es ;’ ‘because it was believed by Europeans, that the materials of
porcelain were matured under ground one hundred years! Dr. Johnson's
Dictionary. Cp. Sir Thomas Browne's Vulgar Errors, blr. ii. ch. 5
(Pickering's Ed, vol. ii. pp. 352-4l. Several authorities are there cited
both for and against this ‘common belief!

ln Col. Yule's Edition of Marco Polo, the passage given above is re-
jected as an interpolation of Ramusio. Commenting on it, Col. Yule says τ
‘This story of the life-long period during which the porcelain day was
exposed to temper long held its ground, and probably was only dispelled
by the publication of the details of the King-te·ching manufacture by Pera
d'Entrecolles in the Lettres Edifiantes!
