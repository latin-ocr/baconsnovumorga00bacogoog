‘Personne n'a mieux connu que lui la cause de nos erreurs; car il a
vu que les idees, qui sont l'ouvrage de l’esprit, avaient ete mal faites,
et que, par consequent, pour avancer daus la recherche de la verite,
il fallait les refaire! * * * * ‘Bacon proposait une methode trop
parfaite, pour etre l’auteur d'une revolution, et celle de Descartes
devait reussir, parce qu'elle laissait subsister une partie des erreurs.’
In the Histoire ¹Modeme (which, however, appeared after the publica-
tion of tlte Encyclopedie), besides passing a high eulogium on Bacon,
he gives a brief summary of a portion of the F irst Book of the Novum
Orgwnum. See livre xx. ch. 12. It may be worth noticing that
Condillac’s objections to Bacon's threefold division of the sciences
are peculiarly acute and effective.

In 17 51 appeared 'the Encyclopddie This work not only contained
a flattering article on ‘Baconismess but,' rn the Discours Prelirninaire
by D 'Alembert, he rs styled‘ le plus grand, le plus universal, et le plus
eloquent des Philosophes.’ The exaggerated tone here adopted (as,
for instance, ‘Bacon, ne dans le sein de la nuitla plus profonde, sentit
que la Philosophie n'etoit pas encore '), as well as the fact that the
Encyclopaedists claimed Bacon as one of themselves, not unnaturally
gave rise to a violent reaction against him, such as we witness in the
work of De Maistre‚ which will be noticed in a subsequent section.

It is unnecessary to pursue any further the subJect of Bacon’s
reputation and influence in France, and we now turn to Italy.-

That Bacon’s works were well known and esteemed in Italy, even
during his lifetime, is plain frorn the following passage in the Life of
Bacon prefixed by Rawley to his Resuscitatio, published in 1657:

‘His fame is greater and sounds louder in foreign parts abroad,
thanat home in his own nation 3 thereby verifying that divine
sentence, A prophet is not without honour, saw in lais own country,
and in lris oron house. Concerning which Ι will give you a taste only,
out of a letter written from Italy (the storehouse of refined wits)
to the late Earl of Devonshire, then the Lord Candish: I will expect
