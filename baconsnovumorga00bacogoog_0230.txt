inveniendam veritatem. Altera a sensu et particularibus
advolat ad axiomata maxime generalia, atque ex iis prin·

This axioma maxime generale is regarded as a hypothesis, to be hereafter
proved or disproved, but, meanwhile, it serves asa provisional explanation
of the facts, and stimulates to further investigations. From it may be
deduced a number of axiomata media which admit of being constantly
compared with factS, and thus an ever-increasing experience tends to
prove or disprove the axiom in question. lf facts do not agree with

the deductions from the hypothesis, it must be thrown aside as useless v

or modified to meet the exceptions; but if it agree with the facts, there
is a strong presumption in its favour. Even still, however, it must not
be finally admitted as an ascertained truth, till it has been shewn to
conform with the rigorous requirements of the inductive methods, or con·
nected deductively with some still higher generalisations which have been
established on independent grounds. When this final step hasbeen taken,
the axiomata media deduced from it may be accepted with implicit con·
lidence.

Generally speaking, tbe axioma maxime generale, even when conceived
before the axiomata media, will rest on an induction from these, as its final
proof ; asthese themselves will probably rest on lower axioma, and so on till
we reach the axioms which rest on an induction from individual facts.
But, in the order ol conception, though not in the order of proof, the
axioma maxime generale or one of the highest of the intermediate axioma
usually comes first, and this circumstance it is which distinguishes the
method 1 am describing from that commended by Bacon.

The history of the Theory of Gravitation supplies an example of a
scientilic doctrine, the steps of which were established almost in the exact
order which Bacon recommends. This fact may be seen by consulting
the lnductive Table ol Astronomy given in Dr. Whewell's Novum
Organum Renovatum. Moreover, in all sciences this order is the most
convenient mode of representing the laws, when once established, though,
as we have seen, it is by no means that in which they are always actually
established, as a matter of fact. Bearing in mind this qualification, I may
adopt tbe words of Dr. Whewell :—

‘We have, indeed, already explained that science consists of Propositions
which include the Facts from which they were collected ; and other wider
Propositions, collected in like manner from the former, and including
them. Thus, tbat the stars,the moon, theson, rise, culminate, and set,
are facts included in the proposition that the heavens, carrying with thern
all the celestini bodies, bave a diumal revolution about the axis of the
earth. Again, the observed monthly motions of the moon, and the annual
motions of the sun, are included in certain propositions conceming the
movements of those luminaries with respect to the stars. But all these
propositions are really included in the doctrine that the earth, revolving on
its axis, moves round the sun, and the moon round the earth. These
movements, again, considered as facts, are explained and included in the
