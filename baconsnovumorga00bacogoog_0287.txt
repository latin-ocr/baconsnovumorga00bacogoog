into more simple cases, and isolate phenomena so as to simplify our in·
vestigations.' According to the latter alternative, he has in mind the
process described in Bk. ii. Aphs. 18, 19. The true method of induction‚
Bacon appears to have thought, was to draw up tables of presence,
absence, δια, and then, by means of these, to reject out of all the possible
explanations, causes, or forms of the phenomenon, first one, and then
another, thus leaving a residuum of explanations‚ or possible causes, out
of which the true one was to be found. lf one only remained, this would
be the true explanation, cause, or ‘form,’ ‘forma affirmativa, solida, et
vera, et bene terminata’ (ii. 16). If more than one remained, the ‘ exclu-
siva’ might be perfected by means of the ‘praerogativae instantiarum·
and other ‘aids of the understanding’ (see ii. 21), till, at last, the search
was narrowed down to some one ‘form‚' which would be the form required,
orto a small number amongst which the true form, cause, or explanation
would have to be sought in all future investigations. For further informa-
tion on Bacon’s ‘Method of Exclusions,' see Introduction, ξ 9.

⁷¹ See note on Aph. 19, where it is shewn that the fault lies not so
much in framing these wide hypotheses, as in taking them forascertained
truths and not insisting on their due verification.

⁷² Dr. Kitchin refers to i. too-105. 1 think that the reference is rather
to the Second Book.

⁷¹ We may, perhaps, here detect the germ of the domdne, afterwards
propounded with such emphasis by Locke and his successura, that all
our knowledge may ultimately be traced to experience. That this is the
case even with Geometrical Axioms (one of the strongest instances in
opposition to this doctrine adduced by the rival school of psychologists)
hasbeen recently argued on novel grounds, and with a force amounting
almost to demonstration, by Professor Helmholtz, following Riemann, in
two articles in ‘ Mind‚’ No. 3 and No. 10. To individual experience, how·
ever, must be added the facility, acquired by hereditary transmission, of
forming certain ideas and realising certain principles, which, in the history
of the race, have, through constant experience, become specially familiar
to the human mind.
