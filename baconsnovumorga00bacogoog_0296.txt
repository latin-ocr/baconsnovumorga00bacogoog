a stirpibus suis revulsae non essent, sed utero naturae adhae-

ut scientiae suis haereant vestigiis, et in eodem fere statu
maneant, neque augmentum aliquod memorabile sumpserint3
quin potius in primo authore maxime floruerint, et deinceps
declinaverint. ln artibus autem mechanicis ⁹⁸, quae in natura

either that the subject is incapable of scientific treatment, or else that the
scientific mode of treating it has not yet been discovered. Thus, the
ontological problems, which constituted so large a part of the Greek
philosophy, did not, I conceive, admit of any scientific solution, while
to much of the physical speculation of the Greek philosophers no scientific
treatment had yet been applied.

lt has often been brought as a charge against the moral and mental
sciences that they are a mere record of opinions, and admit of no growth.
Provided, however, to adopt Bacon's language, they are ‘founded in
nature,’ that is to say, in the study of man and society, Ι believe this
charge to be emphatically untrue. The phenomena, indeed, are here
more complex than in the physical sciences, and there is a larger amount
of uneducated opinion to be replaced hythe results of scientific investi·
gation3 hence, undoubtedly, the process of growth is slower, but 1 believe
that, with each generation of cultivated men, the materials for a knowledge
of mind, life, and conduct are surely accumulating, while scientific con·
ceptions, when once applied to these materials, admit of constant develop-
ment and further and further applications. lt may be added that in
these sciences, owing to the exceeding familiarity of the phenomena with
which they deal, there are certain early generalizations which it is corn·
paratively easy to make3 and hence, in the philosophies of Plato and
Aristotle, there isalargeramountof sound speculation in these departments
than in any others. But, though, perhaps, they are amongst the first
to blossom, they are the last to ripen.

⁹⁸ Cp. Cogitata et Visa (E. and S, vol. iii. p. 616): ‘Artes enim Me·
chanicas, ut aurae cujusdam vitalis participes, quotidie crescere et perfici ;
Philosophiam vero statuae more adorari et celebrari, nec moveri. Atque
illas in primis authoribus rudes et fere informes ac onerosas se ostendere:
postea novas vires et commoditates adipisci. Hanc autern in primo
quoque authore maxime vigere, ac deinceps declinare. Neque aliam
hujus contrarii successus causam veriorem esse, quam quod in Mechanicis
multorum ingenia in unum coeunt ; in Philosophia autem, singulorum
ingenia ab uno quopiam destruuntur. Nam postquam dedititii facti sunt,
amplitudinem non addere ; sed in uno ornando aut stipando servili officio
occupari. Quare omnem philosophiam ab experientiae radicibus ex quibus
primum pullulavit et incrementum cepit avulsam, rem mortuam esse!
