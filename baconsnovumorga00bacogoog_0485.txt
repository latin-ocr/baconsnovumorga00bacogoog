caloris; viz. calor coelestium, calor animalium, et calor ignis⁴⁷;
quodque isti calores (praesertim unus ex illis comparatus ad
reliquos duos) sint ipsa essentia et specie, sive natura speci-
fica, differentes et plane heterogenei: quandoquidem calor
coelestium et animalium generet et foveat, at calor ignis
contra corrumpat et destruat ⁴⁸. Est itaque instantiasoederrs
experimentum illud satis vulgatum, cum recipitur ramus aliquis
vitis intra domum ubi sit iocus assiduus, ex quo maturescunt
uvae etiam mense integro citius quarn soras; ita ut maturatio
fructus etiam pendentis super arborein fieri possit, scilicet ab
igne, cum hoc ipsum videatur esse opus proprium solis⁴⁹.

‘⁷ This is, even still, a vulgar division oi the different kinds oi heat.
Telesius had anticipated Bacon in criticising it. See De Rerum Natura,
vi. ao, a passage which Bncon had evidently read.

⁴³ See Aristotle, De Generatione Animalium, ii. 3 (Berlin Ed, p. 737a
1, rr. r. l.): διὸ πῦρ μὲν οὐθὲν γεννᾷ ζῷον, οὐδὲ φοίνοτοο συνιστάμενον πυροο·
μένοις οὔτ’ r’v ὑγροῖς οὔτ’ ἐν ξηροῖς οὐθέν· ἡ δὲ τοῦ ἡλίου θερμότης καὶ ἦ τῶν
ζῴον οὐ μόνον ἦ hh τοῦ σπέρματος, ἀλλὰ adr rr περίττωμα τύχῃ τῆς φῦοεος ὃν
ἕτερον, ὅμως ἔχει καὶ τοῦτο ζωτικὴν ἀρχὴν. ὅτι μὲν οὖν ἡ ἐν τοῖς ζῴοις θερμότης
οὔτε πῦρ οὔτε ἀπὸ πυρὸς ἔχει τὴν ἀρχὴν, ἐκ τῶν τοιούτων e'nri φανερόν.

⁴⁹ ‘Tm regular use oi artificial heat in green-houses and conservatories
was not known in Bacon’s time. In the Maison champltre, an encyclo·
paedia oi gardening and agriculture published in 1607, nothing is said
os it; noris there anything on the subject in the writings of Porta,
though in his Ναί. Mag. he has spoken oi various modes ot accelerating
the growtb oi iruits and tiowers. ln the Sylva Sylvamm (412), however,
Bacon speaks oi housing hot-country plants to save thern, and, in the
Essay on Gardens, oi stoving myrtles. The idea of what are now called
green-houses was introduced into England from Holland about the time
nithe Revolution. The orangery at Heidelberg, fonned‚ Ι believe, about
the middle oi the seventeenth century, is said to be the earliest conserv-
atory on record.

‘ lt is related that Albertus Magnus, entertainingthe emperor at Cologne
during the winter, selected ior the place os entertainment the garden oi
his monastery. Everything was covered with sunu, and the guests were
much inclined to be discontented; but, when the feast began, the snow
cleared away ; the trees put forth, first leaves, then blossoms, then fruit ς
and the climate became that oi summer. This glorious summer, which
had thus abruptly succeeded to the winter oi their discontent, lasted
only to the conclusion oi the least, when everything resumed its former
aspect. lt would bea ianciiul explanation, and l know not whether it
bas ever been suggested, to say that Albertus Magnus really entertained
the emperor in a conservatory, and only led his guests through the garden.
See, ior the story, Grimm’s Deutsclre Sagen! Mr. Ellis’ note.
