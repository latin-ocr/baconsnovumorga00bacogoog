(quemadmodum enim sunt res, quae nomine carent per in-
observationem²; ita sunt 01 nomina, quae carent rebus, per
suppositionem³ phantasticam), aut sunt nomina rerum, quae
sunt, sed confusa et male terminata, et temere et inaequaliter⁴
a rebus abstracta. Prioris generis sunt fortuna ⁶, primum
mobile ⁶, planetarum orbes ⁷, elementum ignis⁸, et hujusmodi

existence3 sometimes by words which inadequately or erroneously represent
actually existing things or properties.
² Thus, N aturalists are constantly inventing new names 101 newly dis-
covered species orvarieties. The reader 01 Aristotle’s Ethics will recollect
several moral states which Aristotle describes, but designetes as nameless.
lt hardly needs to be observed that, as a science advances, it finds names
101 these ‘nameless ’ things or qualities.
1Τ1110 word may here be used in its technical sense, 101 which see
Sanderson's Logic, bk. ii. ch. 2.
⁴ Cp. Aph. 41, ‘Estque intellectus’ etc. We might translate inaequaliter
as ‘partially’ Due care has 1101 110011 given to the patient examination 01
all the cases with all their attendant circumstances, and to the absnaction
01 all disturbing influences in the human mind itsels.
⁸ Thus, 0110 01 the dicta ascribed to Anaxagoras is that Fortuna (τύχη)
is nothing more than a cause undiscovered by human reasoning, ἄδηλος
01110 ἀνθρωπίνῳ λογισμῷ. Cp. Juvenal, Sat. x. 365-6:
‘Nullum numen habes, si sit prudentia: nos 10
Nos facimus, Fortuna, deam coeloque locamus!

⁶ ln some of the ancient systems 01 Astronomy, the heavens were sup-
posed to consist of a number 01 hollow and concentric crystalline spheres
revolving at different rates 01 velocity round the earth, and carrying with
them the stars and planets3 all these moveable spheres being contained
within a fixed sphere, or empyreas heaven, which was supposed to be
illimitable in extent and to encircle all the others. The ‘primum mobile'
was the outermost 01 the moveable spheres, and was in sorne systems
identified with, in others distinguished 110111, the coelum stellatum or
sphere containing the fixed stars. lt was regarded as communicating a
motion to all the other spheres, apart 110111 their proper 01 independent
motion, and with them revolving round the earth once 111 twenty-four
hours.

⁷ These are the spheres in which the planets were supposed to be set,
and by which they were supposed to be carried round the earth, each
with its own peculiar motion. Dr. Kitchin quotes Milton, Paradise Lost‚
ν’ ¹⁷⁶' ‘rue aad ears, exea n nen orn nat aies:
There was supposed to be a similar sphere, external 10 the others, in
which the fixed stars were set. See last note. The reader 01 Plato's
Republie will remember a curious illustration oi these crude astronomical
theories 111 the Myth 01 Er at the end of the tenth Book.

³ See note 61 on Aph. 45.
