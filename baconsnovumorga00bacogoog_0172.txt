OPPONENTS os BACON. r43

ν Liebig's onslaught on Bacon (Ueber Francis Bacon von Verulam)
appeared both in German and in English in 1863, and was followed
by a keen controversy between Liebig and Sigwart. (See the next
section, on the Bibliography of the Novum Organum.) The occasion
of this work was Liebig's annoyance at the reiection of some os his
chemical theories by English agriculturists. Their singular obstinacy
must, he thought, be due to some inherent defect in the English
mind, and this suspicion led him to the study os the English phi-
losophers. When, at last, he cameto the works of Bacon, all was
clear. These fumished, if not the source, at least the typical example
of the methods of experiment and reasoning common amongst the
English dilettanti, who had had the temerity to reJect his theories.
Τὴε study oi Bacon thus acquired the charrn of a scientific discovery 3
the writer, be tells us, went much deeperthan before into the subject,
and, hence, the work before us (see Preface to German Edition).

1 baveno hesitation in saying that this work, which is extremely
bitter in tone, and often very inaccurate, contributes nothing new to
the knowledge or appreciation of Bacon's philosophy. lt repeats the
thread-bare arguments employed by Brewster and Lasson‚ but with
an amount of exaggeration and asperity which is utterly foreign
to the second, and would, I think, have been distasteful even to the
first of these writers. The author is, at times, almost as violent as De
Maistre or Stubbe. Thus (Ι quote from the English text) ι ‘Bacon
is conscious that in most instances he is not truthful, and has the
prudence to blunt the weapons of his adversaries beforehand ;’ ‘Vain
seli-praise and detraction of others’ merit go always hand in hand
with his lordship, just as with other vulgar specimens of humanity3’
‘When a boy, he studied jugglery, and his cleverest trick os all, that oi
deceiving the world, was quite successful ς’ ‘ Nature, that had endowed
him so richly with her best gitis, had denied him all sense for truth3’
heis the type ‘of the scientific nut-cracker or the dining philosopher,
which, under James 1, became the fashion⁷⁰;' his scientific investiga·

'³ Iu one oi the numbers oi the Allgemeine Zeitung (Now. 7, 1863), Liebig
waxes still more wroth. Aster describing Becon's work es a caricature oi the
scientific movement of the sixteenth century, and Bacon as following in the path oi
science like a shadow, as pcrodyiug the calm and clear image of truth by his bur·
lesque contorsione, he compares him successively with a newshawker, an ape in
soldier’s-clothes, and a grinder oi scientific instmments, who is uuconscions of their
nse. Truly, not only are the sins of the fathers visited upon the children, but
those of the children upon the rathen! Little can Bacon have anticipated the
penalty he would have to pay for the unenlightened obstinacy oi English farmus
iu the nineteenth oeuturyl ·
