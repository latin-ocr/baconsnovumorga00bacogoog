advantage, consult Schwegler's History of Philosophy· m addition to
Ueberweg and Ritter and Preller.

¹⁸ The well-known four elementa of Empedocles, which were generally
accepted till a comparatively recent date, were supposed by him to have
been mixed up at first in chantic confusion. In order to produce the
κόσμος, they required to be separated and then re-combined in orderly
proportion. The agents in this process were respectively νεῖκος and φιλία.
See Metaph. i. 4.

¹ By tire' Heraclitus understood not dame, but a kind of wann, dry
ether or refined air, which he identified with soul and with the Divine
Spirlt. This fire was regarded as undergoing a constant process of evolu-
tion (πάντα ῥεῖ). By condensatiou it passas into the other and grosser
elements, and then these by rarefaction pass back again into it. Being
thus, aa it were, the common clement or basis, the ὕλη, so to speak, of all
other existences, it may be regarded as itself ‘without distinctive pro
perties,’ or ‘adiaphora'

⁸⁰ The student who has acquainted himself with the speculations of the
last three philosophare whom Bacon cites will hardly be disposed to accord
to them this praise. Their conceptione and theories, when divested of the
metaphorical language in which they are clothed, are certainly of a meta·
physical rather than a physical character. Of Anaxagoras and Democritus
the same remark is also, to some extent, true.

⁸¹ This phrase convicts Bacon of a literary error. The books entitled
Metaphysics (τὰ μετὰ τὸ φυσικά) were so called simply because of the place
assigned to thamin the collected works of Aristode, as next to the Physica.
The designation of these books has, however, been the origin of the terms
Metaphysics, Metapbysical &c Aristotle himself calls the scienee treated
ol ln the ‘Metaphyslcs’ σοφία, θεολογική, or πρώτη ἐπιστήμη.

⁸² The question whether Aristotle was a realist, a nominalist, ora
conceptualist has been frequently debated. Confining ourselves to the
issue between the nominalists and realists, the general drift of his writings
and a majority of individual passages would favour the alternative that, had
the precise question between Nominalism and Realism been raised in his
time, he would have adopted the nominalist solution of the question as to
the nature of Universals The most emphatic passage, perhaps, in support
of this view is thatin the Categories, ch. 5 (pa a 11 ded: οὐσία δέ ἐστιν ἡ
κυριώτατά τε καὶ πρώτως sul μάλιστα λεὶομίνη, ἣ μήτε καθ’ ὑποκειμένου rcvds
