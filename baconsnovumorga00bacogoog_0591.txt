562 NOVUM ORGANUM·

motus communi et inveterata opinione habetur pro proprio
coelestium. Attamen gravis de illo motu lis est inter non·
nullos tam ex antiquis quam modernis, qui rotationem terrae
attribuerunt. At multo fortasse justior⁸⁰ movetur controversia
(si modo res non sit omnino extra controversiam), an motus
videlicet iste (concesso quod terra stet) coeli finibus conti·
neatur, art potius descendat, et communicetur aeri et aquis ⁸¹.

Motum autem rotationis in missilibus, ut in spiculis, sagittis,
pilis sclopetorum‚ et similibus, omnino ad motum lr'bertat‘is
rejicimus ⁶².

(18) Sit Motus Decimus Octavus, Motus Τ repzdotrbnis, cui
(ut ab astronomis intelligitur) non multum fidei adhibemus ⁸³.
Nobis autem corpomm naturalium appetitus ubique serio
perscrutantibus occurrit iste motus; et constitui debere videtur
inspeciem. Est autem hic motus veluti aeternae cujusdam
captivitatis. Videlicet ubi corpora non omnino pro natura
sua bene locata, et tamen non prorsus male se habentia,

to circulor motion, that is, unless we reject the sixth and seventh species
ol variation, it will not be necessary ior us to suppose the poles themselves
to be movable: in other words, that the phenomena oi which we could
by this hypothesis give an account may be adequately represented without
it by means ol spirals.'

⁶⁰ This language, the reader will perceive, exactly aecords with what
we have so osten elsewhere found to be Bacon's opinion not only as to the
annual, but also as to the diurnal motion oi the earth.

⁸¹ Cp. Aph. 36 (2), and notes.

⁸³ See ‘Motus tertius' above, and Aph. 36 (6).

⁸³ ‘The name of trepidation was given by the Alphonsine astronomers
to a motion by which they imagined the starry heaven to be affected, and
in virtue os which its equinoxes described small circles ot' nine degrees
radius about those ol the ninth or next superior orb. To account ior this
motion they introduced a tenth orb. The phenomenon‚ however, thus
accounted sor was altogether imaginary, although it is true that the length
ol the tropical year, by supposed variations os which the idea ol trepi-
tion was suggested, is not rigorously constant. lt may be questioned
whether Bacon’s hesitation to accept the astronomical motion ot trepi-
dation had any better foundation than his doubts whether the proper
motions ot' the planetary orbs were anything more than “res confictae et
suppositae.” [See Aph. 36 (a).] The question oi the existence
or non-existence oi trepidation could only be decided by a person
conversant with the details ol the received system ol astronomy! Mt.
Ellis’ note.
