CAUSES OF ARISTOTLE'S FAILURE IN PH YSICS. 69

absence os verification. Oi the first, it may be shewn (as has been
abundantly done by Dr. Whewell in his History ol the Inductive
Sciences and by Mr. G. H. Lewes in his work on Aristotle, and as
will be obvious to any one acquainted with Aristotle's physical
treatises), that it is very inaccurately stated. Aristotle, especially in
his History of Animals, has collected a large number of laets, though
the laets may not always be well selected or precisely described. As
to the second charge, not only does it err in vagueness, but it may
be met with a plea ol justification. ‘Abstract reasoning,’ provided
it be properly conducted, is quite as essential a factor os science, as'
is the accumulation of laets. The third charge (which is that ad-
vanced by Dr. Whewell⁸³l is certainly well-grounded, but it specilies,
as it appears to me, only one ol many causes, while it leaves un·
answered the question, ‘Why are Aristotle's ideas inappropriate to
his iactsi', one ol the very problems to be solved. Nor does it seem
to me that the fourth cause (which is that assigned by Mr. Lewes in
his work on Aristotle) supplies an adequare explanation. For what
is Verilication? It is the confirmation ol one mode of proos by
another, as, lor instance, ol induction by deductim, or os deductiori
by induction. But, though Aristotle’s reasoning is undoubtedly often
deficient in this respect, and especially in the confimration os his
a pn’ori arguments by an inductive examination os facts, yet surely
this is not an exhaustive account of the causes which contributed to
render so large a proportion os his physical researches sutile.

To me it appears that many circumstances combined to mar his
efforts in this department os philosophy. Without attempting a
complete enumeration, and without pretending that those here given
are always mutually exclusive, 1 may specisy the following:

(ι) His observations, though very numerous and osten very care-
iully conducted, were not infrequently inaccurate or insufficient,
owing either to his own delects as an observet or, perhaps still
oltener, to his relying too implicitly on the authority of others. I
may reler sor instances to some os the cases adduced by Mr. Lewes

in his Aristotle (see, especially, pp. 272. 3, and p. 332), and hythe
author os an exceedingly interesting Article on the Historia Animalium
in the Quarterly Review, No. 233, which, while it does justice to
Aristotle, also lreely points out his demerits. See also my inductive
