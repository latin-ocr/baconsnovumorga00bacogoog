verborum et nominum⁹⁶ se insinuarunt in intellectum. Cre·
dunt enirn homines, rationem suam verbis imperare. Sed fit
etiam ut verba vim suam super intellectum retorqueant et
reflectant3 quod philosophiam et scientias reddidit sophisticas
et inactivus. Verba autem plerunque ex captu vulgi induntur,
atque per lineas vulgari intellectui maxime conspicuas res
secant ⁹7. Quum autem intellectus acutior, aut observatio
diligentior, eas lineas transferre velit, ut illae sint magis
secundum naturam; verba obstrepunt. Unde fit, ut magnae
et solennes disputationes hominum doctorum saepe in contro-
versias circa verba et nomina desinant ⁹⁸3 aquibus (ex more
et prudentia mathematicorum) incipere consultius foret, easque
per definitiones in ordinem redigere. Quae tamen defini·
tiones, in naturalibus et materiatis, huic malo mederi non
possunt 99; qnoniam et ipsae definitiones ex verbis constant,

⁹⁷ Cp. Cogitata et Visa, E. and S„ vol. iii. p. 599. lt sometimes happens
that a word only partly expresses the conception which we wish to
convey3 sometimes it expresses more. There is a similar defect in the
distinctions which we attempt to express by two or more contrasted words,
such as organic and inorganic, animal and vegetable, rational and irra-
tional‚ virtue and vice, science and art, and the like. Such words require
constant rectification and definition, in order to make them express exactly
what we wish to express and no more. Words‚ as Bacon says, are inherited
from vulgar use, and hence there is often the greatest difficulty in attach-
ing to them any precise, scientific sense, nor, even when this is done, will-
men always agree to accept or employ them in the sense thus attached to
them.

⁸³ We need only instance such words as idea, sense, cause, reason,
substance, etc, in mental philosophy, and cause, force, form, essence,
motion, etc, in physical philosophy. The truth of this remark as applied
to the questions agitated in morals, politics, and theology will be familiar
to every student.

⁹⁹ Considerable confusion has arisen in the discussion of questions
relating to scientific method from not observing that Definitions are oi
a very different character and occupy a very different position in the
moral and physical sciences, on the one hand, and in the mathematical
sciences, on the other. In Mathematics‚ the inductions by which we gain
the most fundamental truths with respect to space and number are
peculiarly simple and are performed with such rapidity and, for the most
part, at so early an age, that we are hardly conscious of having ever gone
through them. Hence, we are able almost at once to construet definitions
