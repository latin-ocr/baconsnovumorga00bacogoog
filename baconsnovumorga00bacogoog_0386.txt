VIII.

Neque propterea res deducetur ad atomum, quae praesup-
ponit vacuum ⁴⁰ et materiam non fluxam ⁴⁷ (quorum utrumque
salsum est), sed ad particulas veras, quales inveniuntur. Neque
rursus est, quod exhorreat quispiam istam subtilitatem, ut
inexplicabilem: sed contra, quo magis vergit inquisitio ad
naturas simplices, eo magis omnia erunt sita in plano et per·
spicuo; translato negotio a multiplici in simplex, et ab incom-
mensurabili ad commensurabile, et a surdo ad computabile, et
ab infinito et vago ad definitum et certum3 ut fit inclementis
literarum, et tonis concentuum ⁴⁸. Optime autem cedit inqui-

‘simple natures.’ Cp. Aph. 5: ‘Primaria illa et catholica axiomata de
naturis simplicibus ;’ ‘Sed altiores et radicales operationes super naturam
pendent utique ab axiomatibus prImariis.'

⁴⁸ ln Aph. 48 (conclusion), he speaks more doubtfully: ‘Neque enim
pro certo affirmaverimus, utrum detur vacuum, sive coacervatum, sive
permistum!

The Atomic theory ol Democritus postulated a vacuum between the
various atoms ol which matter was regarded as composed. Λεύκιππος δι’
καὶ d ἑταῖρος αὐτοῦ Δημόκριτοι· στοιχεῖα μὲν rd πλῆρες καὶ τὸ κενὸν rival φησι.
Arist Metaph. i. 4 (985 b). Bacon, at least in this passage, while
adopting the opinion that matter, in its ultimate analysis, is an aggregate
of minute particles, repudiates the assumption that these particles are
separated by a vacuum. His own view appears to have been that, is ve
could discover the inmost constitution of things, we should find the ulti-
mate particles, not separated by a vacuum, but so nicely adjusted‚ or
rather so nicely adjusting themselves, as to leave no breach ui contiuuiry
in passing from one to another.

M. Bouillet gives an appropriate reference to the beginning oi the
treatise ‘Cogitationes de Natura Rerum’ (E. and S, vol. iii. pp. 15, dre).
Cp. also Nov. Org. i. 66, ad fin.

On the question whether Bacon did or did not reject the doctrine os
avacuum, see my notes onii. 48 (al and on the conclusion ol the same
Aphorism.

On the conception oi ultimate particles oi matter, epa very interesting
passage in Newton's Optics, blciiiqu. 31 (Horsley's Ed, vol. iv. pp. 260-1).

⁴¹ ‘Ibat is, matter consisting ol rigid, unchangeable‚ and eternal
atoms, as they were conceived os by Democritus. See note 59 on Bk. i.
Aph. 66. Bacon, on the other hand, maintained the theory ol a ‘plica
materiae,’ or a power in the atoms themselves oi expanding or con·
tracting themselves within certain limits. See' conclusion ol ii. 48. This
theory enabled him to dispense with the assumption oi a vacuum.

is imponantes throwing light on Bacon’s doctrine oi forms and simple
