BACON'S SCIENTIFIC OPINIONS. 35

often said, he purposely states his views in an exaggerated form, I do
not think that the tone in which he speaks oi the Copernican theory
can at all fairly be described as that oi ‘positive disdain.' Thus, in
Nov. Org. ii. 35, his language is, ‘At motus ille perennis rotationis
videturesse coelestium proprius; statio, sive quies, videtur competere
globo ipsi terrae “.’ In ii. 36 (2), he proposes the alternative between
the diurnal motion oi the earth and that oi the heavens as a subject
oi serious enquiry, to which an ‘instantia crucis’ may be applied,
though I think there is no doubt as to the side to which he himself
leons. ln ii. 46, speaking os the enonnous velocity which must be
ascribed to the heavens on the ordinary theory, he says with the
greatest candour, ‘quae etiam viros graves ita obstupefecit, ut mallent
credere motum terrae “J Again, in ii. 48 (η), speaking also oi the
motion of the heavens, he says: ‘Attamen gravis de illo motu lis est
inter nonnullos tam ex antiquis quam modernis, qui rotationem terrae
attribuemnt.' In the De Augmentis, iv. 1 (E. and S., vol. i. p. 580),
we have a cautious and discriminating statement, which must have
commended itseli to many men at the time: ‘Constat similiter sen·
tentiam Copernici de Rotatione Terrae (quae huncquoque invaluit),
quia phaenomenis non repugnat, ab Astronomicis Principiis non posse
revinci 3 a Naturalis tamen Philosophiae Principiis recte positis, posse'
In the Thema Coeli, though he sums up his opinion at the end, by
saying ‘Negant terram rotare,’ he speaks, in the body os the work,
as it at one time he had actually hesitated between the two theories:
‘Terra itaque stante (id enim nunc nobis videtur verius)‘³.' This work,
however, was written about 1612. ln the De Augmentis, published
in 1623, he pronounces himself iar rnore positively: ‘harum suppo
sitionum’ (sc. os the Ptolemaic System) ‘absurditas in motum terrae
diurnum (quod nobis constat falsissimum esse) homines impegit “.'

Even this statement, however, emphatic as it is, is lar from exhibiting ²

‘the most positive disdain.’ Lastly, l ought to mention that, in the
Descriptio Globi Intellectualis“, Bacon actually advances some very
cogent reasons against the Copernican theory, as it was then stated,

aurigas, aequa et ancipiti phaenomerrorum advocatione gauderel’ E. aud S., vol:
iii. . 3⁶.

Descriptio Globi intellectualis, see notes on ii. 35.

‘¹ In the next paragraph, speaking oi Galileo's theory oi the tides, he adds: ‘Sed
hoc commentus est concesso non concessibill (quod terra nempe moveatur).‘
