⁸⁸ The vague, general, or superficial appearances of things.

⁸⁶ lt almost seems from this passage as ii Bacon had anticipated the
objections to his methods, based on the consideration of the Plurality of
Causes. But here, as elsewhere, his vague and vacillating use of the word
‘Fonn’ makes it exceedingly difficult to attach a precise meaning to his
language. lt is undeniable, for instance, that the ‘nature' of beat, that
which constitutes it, its ‘ essence‚' as the Schoolmen would have said, is the
same in all cases3 or else we should require two or more distinct words
to express the phenomenon. But its efficient causes, the agencies which
produce it, may be, and are, several; as, ior instance, friction, chemical
combination, electricity, &o Hence, where by ‘form' Bacon means, as
l think he usually does, ⁴ nature,’ there is only one iorm, and to the ques-
tion, for example, What is heati there is, aud only can be, one answer.
But, where by ‘form’ he means ‘law’ or ‘causa’ there may be many
forms ; thus there are, for example, in this sense, as many fonns oi heat as
there are distinct modes oi its production. At the same time, we must re·
member that, if ‚the word ‘form’ with Bacon is vague and obscure, the
word ‘law’ is so also, ancl we are not always justified in assuming that the
latter word is employed by him in the same sense in which it is usually
employed by us. The ‘law’ of an object or quality may be what we
sometimes call the ‘law of its being,’ and thus not diller really from its
‘nature’ To add, therefore, to our perplexity with reference to Bacon's
employment of the word ‘form,’ we can seldom be quite certain in which
ol its two senses, nature or essence, and law or cause, he is using it; and,
in fact, sometimes he seems to be using it in both at once. For a further
discussion of this subject, see Introduction, i 8. The objections founded
on the consideration of the Plurality oi Causes would, of course, not apply
to‘Form’ employed as=Nature. But it need hardly be remarked that
a philosophy which confined itself to investigating the ‘natures’ or ‘es-
sences' of things, without taking any account of their causes or the laws
which determine their production, would be exceedingly defective on the
side of both knowledge and practice.
