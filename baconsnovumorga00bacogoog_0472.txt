LIB. II. 29. 443

elephas inter quadrupedes3 sensus veneris, inter genera tac·
tus3 odor venaticus in canibus, inter genera olfactus. Etiam S
litera apud grammaticos habetur pro monodica; ob facilem
compositionem quam sustinet cum consonantibus, aliquando
duplicibus, aliquando triplicibus⁴3 quod nulla alia litera facit.
Plurimi autem faciendae sunt hujusmodi instantiae3 quia
acuunt et vivificant inquisitionem, et medentur intellectui
depravato a consuetudine et ab iis quae fiunt plerunque.

XXIX.

Inter praerogativas instantiarum, ponemus loco octavo
Instantius Deviantes⁶3 errores scilicet naturae, et vaga, ac
monstra: ubi natura declinat et deflectit a cursu ordinario.
Differunt enim errores naturae ab instantiis monodicis in hoc;
quod monodicae sint miracula specierum, at errores sint
miracula individuorum.. Similis autem fere sunt usus; quia
rectificant intellectum adversus consueta, et revelant formas
communes. Neque enim in his etiam desistendum ab in-
quisitione donec inveniatur causa hujusmodi declinationis ⁶.
Veruntamen causa illa non exurgit ad formam aliquam
proprie, sed tantum ad latentem processum ad formam ⁷.
Qui enim vias naturae noverit, is deviationes etiam facilius '

⁴ An instance of the former caseis to be found in the English word
‘strap,’ of the latter in the German word ‘schwam’

⁵ Dr. Kitchin truly remarks that ‘instances 7, 8, and 9 might have all
come under one head, for Mono[a]dicae in Species are what Deviantes are
in Individuals, and Limitaneae are olisboots of Mono[a]dr'cae, being those
cases in which two species seem to have transgressed one another’s limus!
Satum’s rings, the perturbations of the planet Uranus, and the red flames
which accompany a total eclipse of the Sun would fall under the head
of instantiae Deviantes.

⁶ An admirable instance of an enquiry of this kind is that which led to
the discovery of the planet Neptune, in consequence of the observed
perturbations of Uranus.

⁷ The meaning of this remark is not very obvious. Fora true ex·
planation of these ‘monstra' ought to throw light anthe nature of the
species to which they belong. What Bacon had in mind probably was
that ‘deviating instances’ are due to some arrest or modification of the
process which would ordinarily result in the more usual form, and, hence,
that their explanation throws light, not directly anthe form, but on

the process which leads to the form. lndirectly, however, it would illus·
trate the nature or form as well. ‘
