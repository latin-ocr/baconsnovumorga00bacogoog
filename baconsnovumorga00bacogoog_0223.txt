Generationes mentis et manus numerosae admodum viden-
tur in libris et opificiis. Sed omnis ista varietas sita est in
subtilitate eximia, et derivationibus paucarum rerum, quae
innotuerunt; non in numero axiomatum‘.

² The word Axioma is used by Bacon os any general proposition. lu
Aphorism 103, Axiomata are contrasted with ‘Opera ’ and ‘particularia’
ln Aphorism 104, he speaks os ‘axiomata generalissima’ (‘qualia sunt
principia, quae vocant, artium et rerum ¹), ‘axiomata media,' and
‘axiomata minora' or ‘infima’ Ol the last class he says, ‘Etenim
axiomata infima non multum ab experientia nuda discrepant.²

In the works of Aristotle, the word ἀξίωμα, even when confined to its
logical sense, is employed in no less than three significations. Sometimes
it is used lor any proposition whatever, as, sor instance, in Topics‚ ix. or
Soph. El, 24 (ed. Bekker, p. 179 b. 12-15) ι αὕτη δ’ οὐκ ἔσται, ἄν τις μὴ ἐπὶ
τοῦ sidium ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ τοῦ εἶναι ἢ πῶς ἔχειν τὸ αὐτὸ άξίωμσ λαμβάνῃ, οἶον εἶ dds
ἐστὶ πατὴρ, ἔστι δὲ σός. Cp. Topics‚ viii. t (p. 156 a 23), viii. 3 lp. 159 a.
4, 5). Secondly, Aristotle shews that he is aware of the signification in
which the term was employed by mathematicians, who then, asnow‚ desig·
nated the first principles of their science as ‘axioma' Λεκτέον δὲ πότερον
ptris ly ἑτέρας ἐπιστήμης περί τε τῶν ἐν ruis μαθήμασι καλουμένων ἀξιωμάτων καὶ
περὶ τῆς οὐσίαι. Metaphysics‚ iii. 3 (1005 a 19-21). Cp. Post. An. i. 10.
Lastly‚ he employs the term in a peculiarly technical sense ol his own, to
designate those ultimate principles or assumptione which are necessary
not to the knowledge os this or that particular science but to any know·
ledge whatsoever.· ln this sense, ἀξιώματα are contrasted with θέσεις, the
first principles oi this or that particular science. Ἀμέσου δ’ ἀρχῆς συλλο-
γιστικῆι θέσιν μὲν λέγω ἣν μὴ ἔστι δεῖξαι, μηδ’ άνάγκη ἔχειν τὸν μαθησόμενόν
τι· ἣν θ’ ἀνάγκη ἔχειν τὸν ὁτιοῦν μαθησόμενον, ἀξίωμα· ἔστιγὰρ ἔνισιτοιαῦτα·
τοῦτο γάρ μάλιστ’ ἐπὶ ruis τοιούτοις εἶάθαμεν ὄνομα λέγειν. An. Prist. l.2
(p. 72a.14-18). Cp. i. 10. As an example of ‘Axioms’ in this sense
may be adduced the ‘Law ol Contradiction‚' which Aristotle describes
(Metaphysicsg iil. 3, p. 1005 b. 33, 34) as φύσει ἀρχὴ καὶτῶν ἄλλων
ἀξιωμάτων πάντων. The Mathematical Axioma are analogous to the
Logical Axioms, inasmuch as they are common to all those branches of
knowledge which Aristotle included within the sphere of ἀποδεικτική.

Some logicians, especially those os the school os Ramus, use the word
Axioma as the equivalent of Propositio or Judicium. Thus Milton (Ars
Logica, lib. ii. cap. α) defines and defends this use ol the word as follows :
‘Axioma est dispositio argumenti cum argumento ¹, qua esse aliquid aut
non esse indicatur. Axioma saepe Aristoteli significat propositionem sive

¹ ‘Argumentum autem cum argumento est id quod arguit cum eoquod arguitur!
