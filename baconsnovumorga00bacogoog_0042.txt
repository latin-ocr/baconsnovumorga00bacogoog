 

WAS THE NOV. ORG. WRITTEN IN LATIN? 13

either asserts or implies inaptitude to write latin. And, as to being
but little engaged in business, Bacon, 11 not already actually appointed
Solicitor General¹⁶‚ was using all his influence to obtain the office,
and was certainly recognised, on all sides, as amongst the soremost
men both at the Bar and in Parliament How little idea Liebig could
have had 01 the pressure 01 public life in England‚ 01 the nature
01 the office 01 Solicitor General‚ or 01 the state 01 public business
at this time, it is quite unnecessary for me to point out to any
English render. Moreover, Bacon’s mind was already lull 01 his
philosophical projects and 01 the great revolution which he was to
acoomplish in the study of nature. Was it likely that he wouldwaste his
time in turning into Latin a work which already existed in English?

Such is the exceedingly slender character 01 the negative evidence
on which we are required to accept the very sweeping assertion‚
that Bacon could not write *Latin and that all his works were
originally composed in English!

But, with respect to the Novum Organum, it happens that we pos
sess positive evidence to the contrary. Archbishop Tenison (writing
in 1678) states distinctly: ‘The Second Part 01 his Great Instaura-
tion (and so considerable a part 01 11, that the name os the whole is
given to it) is his Novum Organum scientiarum, written by himself
in the Latin Tongue¹'.' And, to make this evidence the more
weighty, it comes immediately after a description 01 the negotiatione
between Bacon and Playier about the translation 01 the Advancernent
01 Learning, and a criticism 01 the translation 01 the De Augmentis
into English by Dr. Gilbert Wats. The evidence 01 Tenison I
regard as almost conclusive, but itis as well, perhaps, to mention one
or two subsidiary arguments. Hume (History 01 England. vol. vi.
p. 191) states, in a criticism 01 Bacon’s style, which shews how
partial and superficial such judgments ordinarily are: ‘Most 01 his
perlormances were composed in Latin 3 though he possessed neither
the elegance 01 that, nor 01 his native tongue’ Nor, till the time
01 Liebig (who certainly had no special means 01 knowledge), am
lavare that any one ever questioned the Latin composition 01 the
Novum Organum as wellas 01 several 01 Bacon’s other works.

ι’Β110011 was finally, aster much delay in filling up the appointment, made
Solicitor General on June 25· 1607. Playler died, Feb. 1, 1608-9. The letter 01
11110011 to Playser was, according to Mr. Spedding. ‘certainly written “ somewhile ''
aller November 1605, when the Advancement 01 learning was published (·a good
while since,' according to Bacon himself), and certainly not alter July 1608?
