490 NOVUM ORGANUM.

naturalis, emanans a corpore, subsistere possit aliquo tempore
et aliquo loco omnino sine corpore ; prope est ut possit etiam
emanare in origine sua a substantia incorporea. Videtur enim
non minus requiri natura corporea ad actionem naturalem
sustentandam et devehendam, quam ad excitandam aut gene-

randatn.
XXXVIII.

Sequuntur quinque ordines instantiarum, quas uno voca·
bulo generali Instantius Lampadis³⁵ sive informationis Primae
appellare consuevimus. Eae sunt quae auxiliantur sensui.
Cum enim omnis interpretatio naturae incipiat a sensu ³⁰, atque
a sensuum perceptionibus recta, constanti, et munita via ducat
ad perceptiones intellectus, quae sunt notiones verae et axio-
mata3 necesse est ut, quanto magis copiosae et exactae
luerint repraesentationes slve praebitiones ipsius sensus, tanto
omnia cedant facilius et foelicius. ’

Harum autem quinque instantiarum lampadis, primae ro-
borant, ampliant, et rectificant actiones sensus immediatas;
secundae deducunt non-sensibile ad sensibile; tertiae indicant

oi itin ourselves in all our voluntary motions, thch are produced iu us
only by the Iree action or Thought ol our own miuds, and are not nor can
be the effects oi Impulse or Determination oi the motion oi blind matter
in or upon our bodies* ⁴* ⁴* ’Tis an over-valuing ourselves to reduce all to
the narrow measure oi our capacities3 and to conclude all things impos·
sible to hedone, whose manner oi doIng cxceeds our comprehension.
This is to make our comprehension infinite or God finite, when what he
can do is limited to what we can conceive of it.¹ In bk. ii. ch. ²3· § 32,
and elsewhere, he maintaius that it is ‘no more a contradiction, that
Thinking should exist separate and independent from Solidity, than it is
a contradiction, that Solidity should exist separate and independent from
Thinking* l* ⁴* and, having as clear and distInct ideas in us oi Thinking as
oi Solidity,l know not why we may not as well allow a thinking thing
without Solidity, i. e. immatm'al, to exist, as a solid thing without Think-
ing, i. e. matter, to exist) Hobbes, on the other hand, regarded the expres-
sions ‘incorporeal spirit,’ ‘incorporeal substance: δια, as contradictions
in terms, and seems to have thought that they had no meaning, even when
applied to God. See Leviathan‚ Part i. ch. 12, Part iii. cb. 34, and other
places.

⁸⁶ The ‘Instances’ thus t'ar described have for theis office to assist the
Understanding; the next five, called generically ‘ Instances of the Lamp:
serve to inform or supply the defects oi the Senses.
