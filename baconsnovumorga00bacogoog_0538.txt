Historia Animalium and 10 1110 De Generatione Animaliurn (see especially
1160011111. 11 01 the latter treatise). Amongst the most interesting points
01 Aristotle’s doctrine are the theory that spontaneous generation is due to
the molsture which is found in putreiying matter (De Gen An. 111. 11), and
the statement that eels are the only animals, possessing blood, which do not
arise either from congress or 11001 eggs (Hist. An. 11. 16). Mr. Lewes has
some good remarks on Aristotle's doctrine 10 his ‘Aristotle‚’ pp. 364·6.

Bacon does not seem to have entertained any doubt as to the generation
01 animals 11010 putrefaction. Cp. Sylva Sylvarunt‚ Exps. 328, 9003 His·
toria Densi et Rari (E. and S., vol. 11. p. 264). Sir Thomas Brorvne in his
Enquiries into Vulgarand Common Errors (first published 10 1646) appears
to receive the doctrine with as little questioning. See, 101 instance, bk. 11.
011. 61 ‘So when the ox corrupteth into bees, or the horse into hornets,
they come not forth in the image 01 their originals. So the corrupt and
excrementitious humours 10 11100 010 animated into lice,’ and more to the
same effect. He even seems to believe in the equivocal generation 01
01100 (bk. 111011. 28). These theories were all but finally disposed 01 by
Harvey in his great Treatise, De Generatione Animalium, first published in
1651. There he maintains the thesis ‘Ovum esse primordium 001010000
omnibus animalibus?

⁸³ And yet 11 is plain that Bacon did not object to vivisection. See the
passage in the New Atlantis (E. and S, vol. iii. p. 159), beginning with
the following remarkable sentences: ‘We have also parks and inclosures
01 all sortsol beasts and birds, which we use not only 101 view or rareness,
but likewise lor dissections and trials3 that thereby we may take light
what may be wrought upon the body 01 man. Wherein we find many
strange effects: as continuing 111010 them, though divers parts, which you
account vital, be perished and taken lorth3 resuscitating 01 some that seem
dead in appearance; and the like. We try also all poisons, and other
medicines upon them, as well 01 chirurgery as physic! And, 10 1110 De
Augmentis (iv. a, E. and S, 101. 1. pp. 593-4), there is, perhaps, a still more
remarkable passage, in which, while accepting the condemnation passed by
Celsus 00 vivisection 011110 human subject, he thinks that considerations
both 01 ‘utility and humanity’ may be reconciled by substituting the vivi·
section 01 brutes. ‘De illo vero altero delectu circa Anatomiam (nempe
quod non lieri consueverit in corporibus vr'visl quid attinet dicere? Res
enirn haec odiosa et barbara, et a Celso recte damnata. Neque tamen illud
minus verum est (quod annotatum 11111 0 priscis) poros complures et meatus
et pertusiones, quae sunt ex subtilioribus, in anatomicis dissectionibus non
comparere; quippe quae in cadaveribus occluduntur et latent; curn in
viventibus dilatentur, 01 possint esse conspicui. ltaque 111 01 usui consula·
