BACON’S SCIENTIFIC AT T AINMENTS. 39

illis regantur, sed quatenus habeant passiones communes. Quamo
brem hanc partem Astronomiae, quae Physica est, desiderari statuimus.
Eam Astronomiam Vivam nominabimus, ad differentiam bovis illius
Promethei suffarcinati, et solummodo figura tenus bovis! This
passage might almost be regarded as a prediction not only oi the
discoveries oi Newton, but ol the mode in which he made them.
And, though views oi this kind were already beginning to be in the
air, it might be maintained, not without probability, that passages
such as these, so admirablyexpressed,so fullos hope, and so rich
in suggestion, had no inconsiderable share in bringing about the
magnificent results achieved in the studies ol astronomy and
mechanica by the next generation. As Dr. Whewell says, ‘however
erroneous might be the points ol Bacon's positive astronomical creed,
these general views of the nature and position os the science are most
sound and philosophical ⁴.’

From the consideration ol the justness and possible influence of
Bacon’s views on the union of physical and formal astronomy and on
the necessity oi combining the explanations of celestial and terrestrial
phenomena‚ we pass hya natural transition to the famous passages '¹
on Attraction. In the lettres sur les Anglois (1728-17 30), which,
though they certainly did not create, undoubtedly did much to revive
the celebrity ol Bacon in France, Voltaire says at the end oi a long
eulogium: ‘Mais ce qui m'a le plus surpris, c'a ete de voir dans
son livre, en termes expres, cette Attraction nouvelle dont M. Newton
passe pour l’inventeur⁸.' And the Article on Bacon in the Diction-
naire Philosophique begins: ‘le plus grand service peut-&tre que
FrancoisBacon ait rendu ala philosophie a ete de deviner l’attraction.’
This praise, as 1 shall presently observe in the section on Bacon's
Influence on Philosophy and Science, I believe to be greatly exag-
gerated, lor it was the discovery os the precise law oi Attraction and
its illustration in so many departments ol nature rather than the mere
divinationoi its influence which constituted the peculiar meritos
Newton; but, at the same time, few, I think, can read the passages
in Bacon, where he alludes to this subject, and fail-to recognise their
remarkable character. Even allowing for Gilbert’s influence ⁶, l think
that the passage in Nov. Org. ii. 36 (3), and the Instantia Crucis

‘ History oi tbe Inductive Sciences, bk. vii. eh. 1.
· ⁵ lettre xii.
⁸ As 1 remark in my note on the Text, even ll tbe idea was suggested to Baeon

by tbe work oi Gilbert, he ought, at least, to bave the credit oi having detacbed the
conception ol attraotion from that ol magnetism.
