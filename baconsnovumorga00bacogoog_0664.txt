per circulum: motu scilieet aeterno et infinito. Quae bene

Μ ‘This passage is wholly in accordance with the Peripatetic system ol
physica. But the modifications which Bacon goes on to enumerate, to
which, as he conceives, the eternal circular motions oi the heavenly bodies
may be subject, are sufficient to destroy the whole d prron' argument in
favour ol such a system of astronomy as that which we find in the twell'tb
book ol the Metaphysics lt has not been sufficiently observed that the
Ptolemaic system is no less at varianee with the Peripatetic philosophy
than the heliocentrieal. The attempts ol Turrianus and Fraeastorius to
construet what may be called an orthodox system oi astronomy-that is
one in which all the motions should take place in circles oi which the earth
is the centre-was suggested chiefly, as we leam from the Homoeentriea
os the latter, by the wish to reconcile astronomy and philosophy. lt had
no scientilie value, since it leit all the phenomena ol variations of parallax
and apparent diameter unexplained, or, at any rate, gave an explanation ol
them which no astronomer would accept. lt was nevertheless favourably
received by the systematie Peripaticians. See, sor instance, Flaminius,
De prima Philosoph. Paraph. p. 119. (1 quote the Basle edition of 1557.)'
Mr. Ellis' note.

⁶² That is, nine respects in which the motions may differ.

⁸⁸ That is, libration.

The reader need hardly be again reminded tbat he will find a detailed
account os Bacon's astronomical views (written, however, about eight years
besore the publication ol the Novum Organum), in the Descriptio Globi
Intellectualis and the appended' tract Thema Coeli (E. and S., vol. iii.
