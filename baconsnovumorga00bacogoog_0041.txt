12 INTRODUCTION.

Secunda, sive Scientia Activa, which, in its full extent, was to be the
work os posterity, Bacon hoped himself to supply ‘initia non con-
temnenda! For any special treatise‚ however, which can be referred
to this head, we search in vain amongst his works. Nor is this
iact without its explanation. The Scientia Activa was to depend
on the knowledge of ‘Fonns’ but how far Bacon was from having
attained to a knowledge oi ⁴ Forms' and how vague was the concep
tion which he often attached to this term, will be only too familiar to
the attentive student of the Novum Organum. The story which he
applies to the Alchemists ¹⁵ of the old man who bequeathed to bis
sons a piece oi gold hidden in a vineyard applies also, in no small
measure, to himself. He did not discover ‘Forms,’ buthe did what
was os far more value to posterity; he recalled men to the observation
of facts, gave an impulse to the study oi nature, and, if not the
founder oi the Inductive Method, at least contributed more than any
other man to its wider, more correct, and more fruitful employment.

ΙΝ one of his articles in the Allgemeine Zeitung (Nov. 3, 1863),
Liebig asserts roundly that Bacon wrote none oi his works in Latin3
that they were translated by people who knew nothing os the subiects
oi which they treated, and, as Bacon was not very clear upon them
himself, we may imagine the result! In another article (March 6,
1864), he is especially angry with Sigwart ior having called in
question this assertion, and reiterates dogmatically the statement
that all the Latin works of Bacon required the intervention oia
translator. The proof isa letter from Bacon to Dr. Playfer of
Cambridge (given in Spedding’s Liie and letters, vol. iii. pp. 300,
301), requesting him to undertake the translation of the Advance-
ment oi learning. Liebig argues that, is, at the age of forty-six
(he should have said about the age of iorty·six oriorty-seven3 ior
there is nothing enabling us to fix the exact date of this letter), and
when he had but iew engagements‚ Bacon did not recognise his
aptitude sor translating his first scientific work into Latin, it is hardly
likely that he would possess this aptitude in bis sixtieth year, when he
held high office under the Crown, and was immersed in business.
Now, there is nothing whatever in Bacon’s letter to Playier which
