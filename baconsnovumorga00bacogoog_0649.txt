motus communi et inveterata opinione habetur pro proprio
coelestium. Attamen gravis de illo motulis est inter uon-
nullos tam ex antiquis quam modernis, qui rotationem terrae
attribuerunt. At multo sortasse justior⁸⁰ movetur controversia
(si modo res uon sit omnino extra controversiam), an motus

videlicet iste (concesso quod terra stet) coeli finibus conti·
neatur, an potius descendat, et communicetur atri et aquis ⁰¹.
Motum autem rotationem missilibus, ut in spiculis, sagittis
pilis sclopetorum, et similibus, omnino ad motum libertatis
rejicimus ⁸2.

(18) Sit Motus Decimus Octavus, Motus T reputationis, cui
(ut ab astronomis intelligitur) non multum fidei adhibemus ⁶³.
Nobis autem corporum naturalium appetitus ubique serio
perscrutantibus occurrit iste motus3 et constitui debere videtur
inspeciem. Est autem hic motus veluti aeternae cujusdam
captivitatis. Videlicet ubi corpora non omnino pro natura
sua bene locata, et tamen non prorsus male se habentia,

to circular motion, that is, unless we reject the sixth and seventh species
os variation, it will not be necessary lor us to suppose the poles themselves
to be movable: in other words, that the phenomena ol which we could
by this hypothesis give an account may be adequately represented without
it by means ol spirals.’

⁶⁰ This language, the render will perceivc, exactly accords with what
we have so often elsewhere found to be Bacon’s opinion not only as to the
annual, but also as to the diurnal motion of the earth.

⁰¹ Cp. Aph. 36 (2), and notes.

θ’ See ‘hlotus tertius' above, and Aph. 36 (6).

⁸³ ‘The name oi trepidation was given by the Alphonsine astronomers
to a motion by which they imagined the starry heaven to be affected, and
in virtue ol which its equinoxes described small circles of nine degrees
radius about those ol the ninth or next superior orb. To account ior this
motion they introduced a tenth orb. The phenomenon, however, thus
accounted lor was altogether imaginary, although it is true that the length
of the tropical year, by supposed variatione ot which the idea oi trepi-
tion was suggested, is not rigorously constant. lt may be questioned
whether Bacon's hesitation to accept the astronomical motion ot trepi-
dation had any better foundation than his doubts whether the proper
motions os the planetary orbs were anything more than ‘⁴ res confictae et
suppositae.’' [See Aph. 36 (2).] The question of the existence
or non-existence ol trepidatiou could only be decided by a person
conversant with the details of the received system ol ashonomy! Mr.
Ellis’ note.
