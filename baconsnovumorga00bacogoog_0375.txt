processu ad formam) res perfunctoriae sunt, et superficiales,
et nihili sere ad scientiam veram et activam. Neque tamen
obliti sumus nos superius notasse et correxisse errorem mentis
humanae, in deserendo formis primas essentiae1⁴. Licet enim
in natura nihil vere existat praeter corpora individua ¹⁵, edentia
actus puros individuos ex lege3 in doctrinis tamen, illa ipsa

ever, simply be the material and efficient causes, as popularly assigned.
Thus, lor instance, we might say that vegetable matter was the material
cause oi coel, and continued pressure its efficient cause. But Bacon would
insist on knowing its inmost structure and the secret process by which it
had passed from its original condition into its present state.

¹⁴ Sc primas partes. ' The passage to which he alludes is undoubtedly
Bk i. Aph. 51, where the ‘ ionns ' which he condemns are apparently tbe
ι’δέιιι of Plato (cp. Bk. i.Aph. 65), and where he insists on the investigation
of the matter rather than the form. ‘Materia potius considerari debet,
et ejus schematismi, et meta-schematismi, atque actus purus, et lex actus
sive motus; iormae enirn commenta animi humaui sunt, nisi libeat leges
illas actus formas appellare: Fonns (in the sense of the Platonists and
some oi the Scboolmen), as abstracted from matter, Bacou rejected
altogether3 instead of being the principal constituents oi being l‘primao
partes essentiae ’), he denied that they had any existence at all. His own
‘forms' whatever their precise character may have been, were to be
arrived at only by an investigation oi matter, and bad no existence apart
from matter. Hence, the opposition between form and matter had no
placeio his philosophy, and ‘to assign to forms the principal share in
being' became an unmeaning phrase

¹³ lle is bere again combating the Platonic and Scholastic Realism.
Strictly speaking, there exist only individual bodies, with their individual
manifestations. We may translate the next clause, ‘giving iorth individual
manifestations (ἐνέργειαι) according to law! The laws according to which
individual bodies exhibit their various manifestations are the proper object
oi knowledge, and such knowledge is the only guide to practice.

This sentenoe, combined with Bk. i. Aph. 1, aliords, perhaps, one oi the
best statements we have oi the Nominalist, as opposed to the Realist,
theory oi the nature and objects ol knowledge.

¹⁸ ‘Clauses' or ‘ sections! l think that Mr. Ellis (see General Prelace,
p. 31) interprets this term rightly, in referring it to the ‘simple natures'
into which Bacou (see Bk. ii. Aph 17) regarded the forms oi substances as
admitting oi resolution. A ‘forma copulata' (as oi lion, gold, dre) is a
‘conjugium naturarum simplicium‚’ and hence the ‘simple natures' may be
regarded as ‘clauses' oi the forma copulata.

There would, however, be no difficulty in interpreting ‘paragraphus'
