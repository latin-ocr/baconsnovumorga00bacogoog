⁶⁹ These instances are neither more nor less than subordinate inductions
made with the view of leading up to larger inductions, or afterwards
employed for that purpose. Notice the expressions ‘tanquam formam
minorem,' ‘formae particulares: &c

“‘Collective instances,'” says Sir John Herschel, ‘in Bacon's classifica-
tlon, are no other than general facts, or laws of some degree of generality,
and are themselves the results of induction. But there isa species of
collective instance which Bacon does not seem to have contemplated‚ of a
peculiarly instructive characte13 and that is, where particular cases are
offered to our observation in such numbers at once as to make the induc-
tion of their law a matter of ocularinspection. For example, the parabolic
form assumed by a jet of water, spouted from a round hole, is a collective
instance of the velocities and directions of the motions of all the particles
which compose it seen al once, thus leading us, without trouble, to
recognise the law of the motion of a projectile. Again, the beautiful
figures exhibited by saud, strewed on reguian plates of glass or metal set
in vibration, are collective instances of an infinite number of points which
remain at rest while the remainder of the plate vibrates; and in con-
sequence afford us, as it were, a sight of the law which regulates their
arrangement and sequence throughout the whole surface. The beautifully
coloured lemniscates seen around the optic axes of crystals exposed to
polarised light afford a superb example of the same kind, pointing at once
to the general mathematical expressiones the law which regulares their
productiori. (See Phil. Trans. 1819.) Of such collective instances as these,
it is easy to see the importante, and its reason. They lead us to a general
law hyan induction which offers itself spontaneously,and thus fumish ad-
vanced points in our enquiries; and, when we start from these, already
“a thousand steps are lost.”

⁴ A fine example of a collective instance is that ol the system of jupiter
or Satum with its satellites. We have here, in miniature, and seen at
one view, a system similar to that of the planets about the sun; of which,
from the circumstance of our being involved in it, and unfavourably
situated for seeing it otherwise than in detail, we are incapacitated from
forming a general idea but by slow progressive efforts of reason. Accord-
ingly, the contemplation of the circumfovial planels (as they were called)
most materially assisted in securing the admission of the Copemican
system' Discourse, dic, ἐξ 194-5.

Professor Playfair adduces as examples of ‘collective Instances’ the ·

three laws of Kepler, which subsequently, in the hands of Newton, led to
