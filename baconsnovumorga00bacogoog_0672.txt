make much the greater impression of the two. But, as it is almost need·
less to add, Bacon entirely mistook the conditions of the problem.

The true theory of the motion of projectiles was first distinetly enun-
ciated by Galileo in the fourth olbis Dialogues on Motion, which were
published at Leyden in 1638 (Dialoghi delle Nuove sciense, Giornata iv,
Florence Ed, vol. xiii. p. 222, dre). On the previous speculations of
Tartaglia, Digges, dac, see Whewell’s History of the Inductive Sciences,
vol. ii. bk. vi. ch. 2. sect. 3, and Drinkwater's Life of Galileo (Lib. Soc.
U. K), ch. 16. lt is curious that one of the books (the Pantometria,
published in 1591), in which Thomas Digges alludes to the compounded
motion of a projectile‚ was dedicated to Sir Nicholas Bacon, Bacon's
father. A series of very interesting remarks on this subject will he found
at the end of the strationem, published by Digges in 1579.

⁸¹ Note this strange application of the doctrine of Final Causes, and the
very doubtful example by which it is supported.

On Public and Private Good, cp. the interesting passages in De Augm.
vii. 1 (E. and S.‚ vol. i. p. 717, tre), or Advancement of Leaming, bk. ii.
(E. and S.‚ vol. iii. p. 420, dre). The application of this distinction to
‘judge and determine tbe controversias wherein Moral Philosophy is
conversant' has a peculiar interest in reference to subsequent ethical
speculation.

⁸² These are the first of the three ‘Instantiae propitiae sive benevolae·
(soe Aph. 44). Their office is ‘dirigere operativam ad ea quae maxime
bominum intersunt! Hence, they are called ‘lntimating lnstances ς’ for
they suggest to us what are profitable, and what are unprofitable directions
for our experiments‚ energies, or speculations.

⁸³ On the necessity of the union of Knowledge and Praetice, Science
and Art, see i. 81, ii. 4, and the various other passages on the same subject
which abound in this treatise. ln i. 3, the lesson is conveyed in a some·
what different form: ‘seientia et potentia humana in idem coincidunt!
