LIB. Ι. 9—12. 197

ventionem operum3 ita et logica, quae nunc habetur, inutilis
est ad inventionem scientiarum.

XII.

Logica‚ quae in usu est, ad errores (qui in notionibus
vulgaribus fundantur) stabiliendos et figendos valet, potius

quam ad inquisitionem veritatis; ut magis damnosa sit, quam
utilis.

it sailed to see its importance, and had not attempted to lay down any
rules lor its employment. Hence, practically, it was exclusively a syllo
gistic logie. Now it is the fonction os syllogism to develope the con·
sequences ol a principle, not to examine the principle itself. But, unless
we examine the principle, how can we be certain of the truth of the
consequentes? We may onlybemultiplying error instead of truth. The
conclusion ol every new syllogism may be only one error the more, and,
from the salse confidence which the mere reiteration ol a proposition
begets in the mind, a principle which at first was received with hesitation
may come to be regarded as unassailable, and be assumed as placed
beyond all doubt. When men have reared a vast superstructureol reason·
ing, they are naturally unwilling to examine the foundations. What is
required, then, not in order to replace, but in order to supplement, the
old logie, is a logie which shall guarantee the premisses as wellas the
conclusione, which shall probe the validity ol our elementary notions aud
first principles, as well as develope their ulterior consequentes. Such a
logie Bacon proposed to supply, or at least to inaugurate.

That Bacon recognised the sunction os the Syllogism as supplementary
to Induction, is evident from several passages oi the Novum Organum
itself. But perhaps his most explicit statement on this subject is to be
found in a letter to Father Baranaan (published in Spedding's Letters and
Lile oi Bacon, vol. vii. pp. 375—7). This letter, which is also interesting
on other accounts, contains the following passage :-

‘N on est meum abdicare in totum syllogismum. Res est syllogismus
magis inhabilis ad praecipua, quam inutilis ad plurima.

‘Ad Mathematica quidni adhibeatur? Cum fluxus materiae et incon·
stantia corporis physici illud sit, quod inductionem desideret ; ut peream
veluti figatur, atque inde eruantur notiones bene terminatae.

‘De Metaphysica ne sis sollicitus. Nulla enim erit post veram Physicam
inventam ; ultraquam nihil praeter divina.

‘ln Physica prudenter notas, et idem tecum sentio, post notiones primae
classis, et axiomata super ipsas per inductionem bene eruta et terminata,
tuto adhiberi syllogismum, modo inhibeatur saltus ad generalissima, et
fiat progressus per scalam convenientem!

On the place ol Induction in Aristotle’s system of logie, l have spoken
in the Introduction.
