BACON'S SCIENTIFIC ATTAINMENTS. 31

neas, and his sanguine expectations of what nature had in store for
those who diligently studied her, may have rendered him peculiarly
liable to be imposed on by these ‘old wives’ fables’

But far the most important and, perhaps at first sight, the least
excusable of Bacon's scientific errors was his persistent rejectiones l
the Copernican theory'³. It seems strange that one who laid claim
to be the great refonner of seience should have steadily refused to
admit the greatest reform in scientific conceptione which had been
proposed for many generations, and which had already been before
the world for eighty years. To say nothing of Copemicans before
Copernicusll, the views of Kopernik himself were first published in a
letter by Rheticus in 1540, though his great work ‘De Revolutionibus
orbium coelestium' did not see the light till the very day of bis death,
May 24, 1543 ⁷⁷. The precise thesis maintained, it must be re-
collected, was that ry the sun be regarded as the imnrovable centre of
the universe (we now, of course, know that it is not), and the earth
be supposed to have both a diurnal and an orbital motion, the
apparent phenomena of the heavens admit ofa far more simple
mathematical explanation than on the received or Ptolemaic system⁷⁸.
Whether this hypothesis represents what really does take place, that
is, whether the mathematica! theory is also the true physical theory,
was another question, which might be resolved differently, or left
unresolved, by those who maintained the former. As Professor De

'⁸ M. Bouillet. in a note on Nov. Org. ii. 3⁶, is ao much startled with thia fact
that he is driven to the supposition that Baeon was deterred from embraciug the
Copernican theory by fear οἱ the inconvenient consequences which might thereby
be entailed on him. ‘sartout sous un roi aussi devot que Jacques 1⁰¹! But this
theory appears to me hardly worth discussion.

ἵ· On which subject, see aa excellent article. entitled ‘Copemieus iu Italy,' in
No. ²99 (Jnly, 1877) of the Edinburgh Review. One of the works reviewed is

⁷⁷ The idea of his system, however, must bave occurred to him before 1507. He
informs Paul the Third iu his Dedicatiou that he had kept the book by him for
four times the uine years recommended by Horace.

'⁸ With reference to the merely hypothetieal character ascribed to his reasoning,
the reader will do well to consult the eurious and interesting admonition ‘Ad Icc-
torem de Hypothesihus hujus operis' prefixed to the work. This admonitiou occurs
in the first, as wellas the subsequeut editions, but it seems not to have been written
by Copemicus himself. It is not necessary for the hypotheses to be true, or even
probable, ‘sed suflicit hoe unum, si caleulum observationibus congruentem ex-
hibeant* The office of the astronomer is confined to observation aud calculation,
‘cum veras causas assequi nulla ratione possit’
