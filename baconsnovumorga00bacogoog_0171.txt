his objections anticipated, if indeed they did not suggest, some oi
the leading criticisms in the two works which follow.

lasson’s monograph on Bacon (Gustav Lange, Berlin, 1860)
appeared in the Jahresbericht iiber die louisenstiidtische Realschule.
Though it only extends over thirty-two pages, it is the weightiest ol
the attacks upon Bacon which I have seen. It is written not only
with more moderatiori, but with more knowledge of Bacon’s writings,
and with more sympathy with the philosophica] spirit in its relation
to science, than is the violent diatribe oi Liebig, to be next noticed.
The writer dwells with much emphasis on the scientific progress
which had been already made in Bacon’s time, and maintains that the
reformation oi science was not the work oi a single man, but
the gradual product os the age. Moreover, the necessity of In-
duction, the appeal to Observation and Experiment, and the practical
aims which should be kept in view in scientific enquiry, had been
insisted on by a host oi writers before Bacon gave utterance to them.
Having, thus, combated Bacon's claim to originality, he next proceeds
toan examinationes his system. Here, he finds special fault with his
mechanical theory ol induction‚ the manner in which he ignores
the activity ol the Understanding (Verstandesthaitigkeit)‚ his criticism
oi Final Causes‚ his conception oi Fonns, his neglect oi quantitative
“ relations, &a Lasson, like Liebig, is especially severe on the Sylva
sylvarum, which he says might have been more appropriately written
in the eleventh than in the seventeenth century. Finally, he puts the
question, ‘Was Bacon really a Philosopher,’ and he answers that,
in the proper sense oi the word, he was not3 he was a genius, but, at
the same time, aDilettante (ein geistreicher Dilettantl. ‘Es lisst
sich die Frage stellen, ob er iiberhaupt ein Philosoph gewesen‚ und
wir denken, die Frage beantwortet sich von selbst in negativem Sinne,
wenn man nicht das Wort Philosophie in ungebiihrlich weitem Sinne
lasst. Aus allgemeinen Gesichtspunkten raisonniren ist noch nicht
philosophiren. * * * * * ln allem diesem kritischen Hochmuth, wie
in det dogmatischen Zuversicht und in dem Unvermiigen, Positives
zu schaffen, ist Baco ein rechter Vertreter der grossen Masse, des
ganz unwissenschaitlichen Bewusstseins. * * * * * Baco ist ein geist-
reicher Dilettant, er hat etwas von Cicero und von Voltaire. Der
beriihmte Harvey hat mit Recht von ihm gesagt: er schreibe iiber
Philosophie, wie ein Lord·kanzler.' That Bacon, however, did great
service in spreading a taste ior experimental enquiry and in drawing
the popular attention to the importante of consulting facts, is allowed
throughout the enquiry.
