effect from writers anterior to or contemporary with Bacon are quoted in
the Introduction, f 12.

⁶¹ Bacon here undoubtedly exaggerates Aristotle's tendency to dog·

stating different solutions of a question, the author leaves his own opinion
doubtful. This occasional uncertainty as to the precise character of his
own conclusions is, in fact, one of the main sources of difficulty to those

⁶⁹ On the doctrines of the New Academy, see note 41 on Aph. 37.

the scepticism of the N ew Academy would form an interesting enquiry
in the history of philosophy. ln the first place, it may be observed that
there was from the beginning a well-marked negative vein in the philosophy
of Socrates and Plato. This tendency, which was connected with their
dialectical method and the determination to examine all sides of a question,

no result to be attained. Then, the εἰρωνεία, or affectation of ignorance,
which was so marked a feature in the conversation of Socrates, and which
is so carefully and frequently depicted in the dialogues of Plato, must have
