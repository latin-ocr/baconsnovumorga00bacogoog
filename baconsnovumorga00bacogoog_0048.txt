BACON’S PHILOSOPHICAL OPINIONS. 19

between unconscious or reflex actions and conscious affections. As
instantes oi the former, he gives the attraction of the magnet‚ the
union oi two bubbles, dre, in the case of insensible bodies, and, in
the case oi sensible bodies, the digestion oi food, the beating oi the
beart and pulse, &c

That the only source of our ordinary knowledge is to be found in
experience Bacon seems to assume throughout his works²⁸‚ though he
never, so lar as 1 recollect, attempts to ascertain the conditions oi
experience or to analyse it into the elements oi which it consists.
The source oi some portions of our knowledge, such as that of ‘the
substance of the rational soul²⁹ ' and oi moral principles ³⁰, is referred
to Divine Inspiration but this, Ι think, is usually the inspiration of
the Bible, given once for all, rather than any constant illumination
specially imparted to the individual. In one place, however, at least,
(De Augm. lib. ix.; E. and S.vol. i. p. 8 31 ³¹), he does undoubtedly refer
our moral sentiments to a sort oi divine influence, acting immediately
and without any dependence on the ordinary avenues oi knowledge.
‘Notandum tamen, lumen Naturae duplici significatione accipi;
primo, quatenus oritur exsensu, inductione, ratione, argumentis,
secundum leges coeli ac terrae; secundo, quatenus animae humanae
interno affulget instinctu, secundum legem conscientiae; quae
scintilla quaedam est, et tanquam reliquiae, pristinae et primitivae
puritatis. In quo posteriore sensu praecipue particeps est anima
lucis nonnullae ad perlectionem intuendam et discernendam legis
moralis; quae tamen lux non prorsus clara sit, sed ejusmodi ut
potius vitia quadamtenus redarguat, quam de officiis plene informet.¹
Here we seem to have a third source oi knowledge, corresponding
almost exactly with what Butler calls ‘conscience³²‚' in addition to
the ‘Sense' and ‘Divine Inspiration’ (there confiued to Theology)

mistaken (see p. 270, n. ι), as to suppose that Baton uses these terms in the sume
sense as Reid and Stewart.

¹⁸ See, for instance, Nov. Org. i. 19-22; De Augm. iii. ι ad init: ‘Omnis
enim seientia duplicem sortitur informationem. Una inspiratur divinitus, altera
oritura sensu ..... Partiemur igitur seientiam in Theologiam et Philosophiam ;'
Distributio Operis (reprinted in this edition), ‘Sensus a quo omnia in naturalibus
peteuda sunt, nisi sorte libeat insanire!

⁹ De Augm. iv. 3 (E. and S., vol. i. p. 606).

³⁰ De Augm. vii. 3 (vol. i. p. 732); ix. (pp. 830. 831).

Ἰ Cp. Advancement ol Leming, bk. ii. (E. and S.. vol. iii. p. 479).

θ’ This faint glimmering, as it were, os a primitive light may be one ol the
excellencies oi the Rational Soul, spoken oi in De Augm. iv. 3 ad init. : ‘Plurimae
enim et maximae sunt Animae Humanae praecellentiae supra animas bmtorum,
etiam philosophantibus secundum sensum manifestae!
