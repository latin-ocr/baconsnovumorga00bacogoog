there proposed (the reader will do well to study the whole of this
section with care), reflect great credit on Bacon’s sagacity, and, even
if they stood alone, would entitle him to some place in the History
of scieneet Not only does he suggest the attraction of the earth’s
mass as the cause of the fall of heavy bodies, but he adds that, if this
be the cause, the nearer the bodies approach the earth, the more
strongly and with the greater force will they be drawn towards it,
while, the further off they are, the weaker and the slower will be
their motions. Moreover, the experiment proposed is itself very
ingenious, and is, in principle, no other than that recently used in
the series of scientific observations instituted in the Dolcoath and
Harton Collieries ⁸. With this passage, which is, however, the most
remarkable, the student may compare what Bacon says on the same
subject in Nov. Org. ii. 35, 37, 48 (9)', in the Aditus ad Historiam
Gravis et Levis (E. and S, vol. ii. p. 80), and in the Descriptio Globi
Intellectualis, cap. 7 (E. and S, vol. iii. p. 762). ln the last passage,
it is only fair to add, he refers to Gilbert. l may also add that in the
Sylva Sylvarum, Exp. 704, Bacon shews a just and intelligent con·
ception of the nature of gravity, when he says that it ‘is a mere
motion of matter, and hath no affinity with the form or kind!

On subsidiary points connected with Astronomy, l may adduce as
examples of Bacon's sagacity the fact that he saw that there must be
some reason why the heavens rotate from east to west, or, as we
should put it, why the earth rotates from west to east ¹⁰, the idea of the
possibility of predicting comets¹¹, and his recognition of the probable
or possible influence of the moon on the spring and neap tides ¹².

of Natural Philosophy, ἦ 196.

⁸ See the remarks of Sir John Herscbel referred to abore, and Mr. Ellis’s note on
the passage. In my own note, 1 have pointed ont certain defects in the experimmt
as proposed, when estimsted in reference to onr present state of knowledge.

' ln this passage Bacon actually contemplates the attraction exerted by the sun
upon the planets: ‘aut sol alliget astra Veneris et Mercurii, ne longihs absint a
corpore ejus, quam ad distantiam certam!
