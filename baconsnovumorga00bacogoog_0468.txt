LIB. II. 27. 439

ostentant3 magnacum vanitate et desipientia, inanes simili-
tudines et sympathias rerum describentes atque etiam quan-
doque affingentes.

Verum his missis, etiam in ipsa configuratione mundi in
majoribus non sunt negligendae instantiae conformes; veluti
Africa, et regio Pcruviana cum continente se porrigente usque
ad Fretum Magellanicum. Utraque enim regio habet similes
isthmos et similia promontoria, quod non temere accidit ⁹³.

Item Novus et Vetus Orbis; in eo quod utrique orbes
versus septentriones lati sunt et exporrecti, versus austrum
autem angusti et acuminati ⁹⁴.

’ Item instantiae conformes nobilissimae sunt frigora intensa

in media (quam vocant) aeris regione, et ignes acerrimi qui
saepe reperiuntur erumpentes ex locis subterraneis: quae
duae res sunt ultimitates et extrema3 naturae scilicet fri-

gidi versus ambitum coeli, et naturae calidi versus viscera

⁹¹ Bacon seems to be comparing the western or corresponding sides of
the two continents. The conformity of the apponte sides is also remark·
able, the projections on one side ansvering roughly to the recesses on
the other.

⁹⁴ Humboldt discusses these and similar phenomena at some length.
See Col. Sabine’s Translation of the Kosmos‚ vol. i. p. 280, &c While
acknowledging that ‘little can be ascertained by investigation respecting
the causal connection of the great phenomena appertaining to the forma·
tion of our continents, and to the analogice and contrasts presented by
their configuration,’ he suggests two principal causes, acting in succession,
which may have determined such configuration. ‘Slight disturbances in
the equilibrium of the elastic forces in the interior of our planet may
have determined their action more towards the northern than the southern
hemisphere, and have occasioned tbe elevation of the dry land in tbe
eastern hemisphere iir the form of a wide connected mass, having its major
axis almost parallel to the equatur,-and, in the western and more oceanic
hemisphere, in a comparatively narrow band, following the direction of the
meridianl Again, ‘Our Atlantic Ocean presents the characteristics of a
valley. lt is as if the tlow of the waters had been directed first towards
the north-east, then towards the north-west, and then again towards the
northeast. The parallelism of the coasts north of 10⁰ of South latitude‚
the projecting and re-entering angles, the convexity of Brazil opposite
to the Gulf of Guinea, and the convexity of Africa to the Gulf of Mexico,
all favour this view, which at first may seem too hazardous. ln the
Atlantic Valley, as is indeed usually the case in the form os large masses
of land, coasts deeply indented and fringed with many islands are placed
opposite to those of a contrary character!
