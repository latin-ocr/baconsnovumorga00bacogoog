BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE NOVUM ORGANUM. 149

Through the kindness 61 Dr. Neubauer (61 the Bodleian Library),
lam able to add that a translation 61 the first boolr 61 the Novum
Orgmum, in Hungarian, by A. Balogh, together with a biography
and arr estimate 61 Bacon’s works and philosophy, was published at
Budapest in 1885. There are also, in the Hungarian language,
reviews 61 De Remusat and Liebig on Bacon, as well as a treatise

(or ? article) on Bacon’s Induction by Greguss (Agoston). The ι

work of John Beyer (published, in Hungary, in 1663) has been
noticed on p. 112, above.

At Cracow, in 1834, there was published a boolr entitled Bakona
Metoda Tlumaczenia Natury (the Baconian Method 61 interpreting
Nature), by Michal Wiszniewslri.

There is a Sanslrrit version 61 the Novum Organnm, published by
order 61 the Govemment 61 the N. W. provinces, for the use 61 the
Benares Sanskrit College, and prepared by Pandit Vitthala S'As‘trl,
Benares, 1852. The materials 161 this version were published in a
separate lorm by J. A. Ballantyne at Mirzapore in 1852. ‘Each

sentence has been written with the view ol being herealter rendered
into Sanslrrit, in order to its eventual reproduction in all the deriva-

tive modern languages of India’

The first attempt at editing the complete works 61 Bacon was
made by J. B. Schiinwetter and J. Gruter, in their edition in Latin,
issued at Frankiort on the Main in 1665 ⁸². The Latin Works were
published by Wettstein at Amsterdam in 1684, and reprinted in
1695 and 1730. There was an edition 61 the Opera Omnia ‘opera
Simonis Johannis Amoldi' at Leipsic in 1694. An edition in 4vols.
was issued by J. Blackboume at London, in 1730. There was a
handsome Edition‚ with a lile by Mallet, issued in 1746, and this
was followed with tolerable rapidity by several others. The ‘trade
edition,' in ten volumes octavo, is a reprint ol the quarto edition by
Birch, 1763. Finally, we have Basil Montagu's edition, Piclrering,
