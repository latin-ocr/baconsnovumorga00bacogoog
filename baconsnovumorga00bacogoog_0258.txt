Hujusmodi itaque sunt tilulo, quae vocamus rilola tribus:

ifit be a possibility of motion, we have two cases, according as the motion
or process is (1) an end in itself, or (2) results in something beyond itself,
an ἔργον τι. Now, in the first case, as, for instance, in walking for the
sake of exercise, the actual as opposed to the possible motion may be in·
differently called a κίνησεν, an ἐνέργεια, and, though hardly with equal pro·
pn'ety, an ἐντελέχεια. ln the second case, suppose we take house-building
as our instance, we bave (ιι) the mere δύναμις or possibility of house-
building, (β) tbe process itself,oix0lloprxr'1, (γ) the result, τὸ ἔργον, the house.
Here, οἰκοδομική, the process, ought strictly speaking to be called a κίνησιν,
but it is also called, though with less propriety, an ἐνέργεια or even an
ἐντελέχεια; but the end or result, the house itself, can only be said to exist
ἐνεργείᾳ or ἐντελεχείᾳ, and the latter expression seems the more appropriate
of the two. The terms ἐνέργεια and ἐντελέχεια are often used interchange·
ably by Aristotle, but, strictly speaking, it would seem that ἐνέργεια (ἐν
ἔργῳ) should be appropriated to a motion which is an end in itself, while
ἐντελέχεια (ἐν τελει ἔχειν) ought to be appropriated to the result of a motion
or process, or to actual as opposed to possible existence.

On this distinction, the student is specially recommended to read Tren-
delenburg's first note to De Anima, bk. ii. ch. r, and to compare the passages
in Aristotle’s works, where the terrns ἐνέργεια and ἐντελέχεια occur. He
should notice particularly Metaph. viii. 6 and Eth. vii. 14 (8). Sir Alex-
ander Grant treats of this distinction at some length in one of the Essays
appended to his edition of Aristotle’s Ethics.

. ‘Actus Purus’ in the present passage, may mean either the process of
development by which one material substance passes into another or the
final result which follows from the meta-schematismos, that is to say, the
change in its structure. Thus, the actus purus might either be the process
by which the acorn passes into the oak or iron into rust, or it might be the
oak or the rust itself. Conformably with these altematives, ‘lex actus sive
motus’ may denote either the law governing the process by which the
final result is attained, or the law expressIng the conditions of the result
itself, that is to say, it may denote either a dynamical law or a statical
law. l am inclined to think that, in this place, it has the former meaning.

⁸⁷ He here alludes to the ἰδέαι of Plato, which were conceived as having
a supra-sensible existence independent of and out of relation to matter.
He himself adopts the phrase ⁴ Forms,’ but in a peculiar sense of his own,
which l have discussed at length in the section of the Introduction just
referred to.
