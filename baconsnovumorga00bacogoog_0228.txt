LIB. J. 13-17. 199

In notionibus nil sani est, nec in logicis, nec in physicis:
non substantia, non qualitas, agere, pati, ipsum esse, bonae
notiones sunt3 multo minus grave, leve, densum, unua, humi-

dum, siccum, generatio, corruptio, attrahere, fugare, elementum,

materia, forma, et id genus3 sed omnes phantasticae et male
terminatae ¹⁸.

XVI.

Notiones infimarum specierum, hominis, canis, columbae,
et prehensionum immediatarum sensus calidi, frigidi, albi,
nigri, non fallunt magnopere; quae tamen ipsae a fluxu
materiae et commissione rerum quandoque confunduntur ¹⁹:
reliquae omnes (quibus homines hactenus usi sunt) aberra-
tiones sunt, nec debitis modis a rebus abstractae et excitatae.

XVII.

Nec minor est libido et aberratio in constituendis axiomati-
bus, quam in notionibus abstrahendis3 idque in ipsis prin-
cipiis, quae ab inductione vulgari ²⁰ pendent. At multo major²¹

est in axiomatibus, et propositionibus inferioribus, quae educit
syllogismus.

malleable, heavy, capable of being exchanged‚ etc, and, without forming
these judgments, 1 should not realise the notion. Now, when we are
dealing with Nature, sound judgments, and, therefore, sound notions can
only be gained by observation of facts and a legitimare generalisation from
those facts. We may see from what bas been said that the Definition
of natural objects or qualities (as distinct from merely technical terms)
ought always to rest on previous inductions.

¹⁸ ill-defined.

¹⁹ lt must be recollected that there is no breach of continuity in Nature
as there is in our distinctions. Hence, our terms or notions are never
exhaustive or adequately representative of the endless varieties of Nature.
Mr. Ellis proposes to read commistione for commissione. ‘From the
context it is clear that Bacon means that the union of bodies o'f different
kinds, by givingrise to new qualities and species intermediate to those for
which we have recognised names, tends to confuse our ideas of the
latter. 1 think therefore we ought to read “ commistione ” for “ com·
missione.”'

²⁰ He is alluding to the Inductio per enumerationem simplicem as dis·
tinguished from the Scientific Induction by which he proposes to replace it.

‘²¹ For, by deducing error from error, we recede further and further

from the truth.
