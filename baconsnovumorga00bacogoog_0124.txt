ANTICIPATIONS OF BACON'S DOCTRINES. 95

Magnitudinem, Naturamque non ratione, quod antiquioribus factum
est, inquirendam, sed sensu percipiendam, et ab ipsis habendam
esse rebus! In the Prooemium to the same work, he speaks, much
in the same tone as Bacon does afterwards, of those who ‘veluti
cum Deo de sapientia contendentes decertantesque, mundi ipsius
principia et causas ratione inquirere ausi, et quae non invenerant
inventa ea sibi esse existimantes, volentesque veluti suo arbitratu
mundum effinxere! And again: ‘non scilicet eo usque sibi homines
placere, et eo usque animo efferri oportebat, ut veluti naturae prae·
euntes [compare Bacon's “anticipatio naturae ’'], et Dei ipsius non
sapientiam modo, sed potentiam etiam affectantes, ea ipsi rebus
darent, quae rebus inesse intuiti non forent, et quae ab ipsis omnino
habenda erant rebus! In opposition to this ambitious method, he
declares his own intention of following only sense and nature:
‘sensum videlicet nos, et naturam, aliud praeterea nihil sequuti
sumus, quae, perpetuo sibi ipsi concors, idern semper et eodem
agit modo, atque idern semper operatur! In book viii, where he ν
discusses the nature of knowledge, he lays down, amongst others,
the following propositions: ‘scientiarum omniurn et geometriae
ipsius principia a sensu haberi, vel proxima eorum, quae sensu
percepta sunt, similitudine, et conclusiones omnes ex iis pendere'
(cap. 4) 3 ‘Conclusiones naturales in eo mathematicis praestare,
quod hae a signo omnes, illae vero a propriis causis propriisque
manant principiis-⁹ (cap. 5.) Here, and elsewhere in this Book,
Telesius enunciates the principle of the origin of all knowledge
in the perceptions of the semes, at least as distinctly, if not more
distinctly, than Bacon himself. With regard to individua] doctrines,
1 shall, from time to time, draw attention in the notes to many
points of agreement between Bacon and Telesius, but I arn not
aware that, as regards method, there is anything more to notice
than the general agreement which I have already pointed out.
There is, so far as I am aware, no attempt in the works of Telesius
to analyse induction, or to give any specific rules for its right
conduct. Ἴ

The origin of knowledge in the perceptions of the senses and the
consequent importance of experience seems to have been acommon-
place of philosophers in the sixteenth century. Caesalpinus (1519-
1603) the adherent, and Patricius (1529-1597) the opponent of
Aristotle, are agreed on this point.

Not to multiply quotations needlessly, I shall pass on to Campanella
(1568-1639), whose name is frequently coupled with that of Bacon
