BACON’S SCIENTIFIC ATTAINMENTS. 43

Exclusion, but rests immediately upon the three tables ofComparentia.
Hence it does not pretend to be the result of formal proof, but onlya
sort of probahle hypothesis based upon the consideration and com·
parison ofa large number of instances. Separating, however, the
question of the mode by which it was arrived at from the nature and
value of the conclusion itself, l think Bacon must be credited with
having in a remarkable manner anticipated one of the most beautiful
and important discoveries of modern science. Stripping it of certain
excrescences, the essential part of the conclusion is that Heat is an
expansive motion amongst the minute particles of bodies. And this,
after much speculation and experimentation, and the predominance,
for a long time, of another theory, namely, that heat is a subtle fluid,
called Caloric, is the precise conclusion ‘at which the most eminent
physicists have at length arrived. Professor Tyndall does Bacon the
justice of quoting in an Appendix¹⁸a considerable portion of the
aoth Aphorism, asillustrating the theory which he has himself so ably
and clearly expounded.

On an impartial investigation, then, of this question ¹⁹, l think we
must conclude that, while Bacon undoubtedly did not possess any
extensive or precise acquaintance with any single branch of science‚
and while, in some respecta, his writings did not keep pace with the
discoveries of the day, his range of vision covered an extraordinarily
vast sweep of knowledge, and his scientific conceptions, and the

¹⁸ See the Appendix to ch. a of Tyndall's Heat a Mode of Motion. It is only
fair, perhaps, that 1 should referto tlre unfavourable opinion of this example ex·
preased by Dr. Wbewell (Philosophy of Discovery, aba 15, 16), who pronotmces
that ‘as an example of the mode of interrogating Nature, it cannot be looked upon
otherwise than as a complete tailure' But, though 1 namot admit thia eriticlsm
as other than very exaggerated even aa to the mode of enquiry, with regard to the
result it is surely a sufficient answer that Bacon did, as a matter of fact, divine the
true nature of heat.

¹¹ lt must be understood that 1 have not attempted to give aa exhaustive account
eitherof Bacon'a scientific errors or of his scientific claims to recognition. In each
ease, l have only attempted to select typioal examples, though 1 think l have in-
cluded nearly all the points of real importante on either side.

Of the invention of the thermorneter, ascribed to Bacon by De Vanzellea and
Bouillet, 1 have said nothing, because l think the fact that Bacon, in none of the
places where he makes mention of this instrument, advances any claim to its inven-
tion, is alone a sufficient reason, if not for positively denyiug his invention of it,
at least for not positively ascribing it to him. Mr. Ellis (in a note on Nov. Org.
ii. 13 (38) and De Remnsat (pp. 34, 35) agree in thinking that the invention has
been ascribed to Bacon without good reason. lt was probably due, in the first
inmaturae, to Galileo.
