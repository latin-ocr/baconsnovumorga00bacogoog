quod non ex attritione manifesto calescat ¹⁴3 adeo ut veteres
somniarent non inesse coelestibus aliam viam aut virtutem
calefaciendi nisi ex attritione aeris per rotationem rapidam
et incitatam ¹⁶. Verum in hoc genere ulterius inquirendum
est, utrum corpora quae emittuntur ex machinis (qualia sunt
pilae ex tormentis) non ex ipsa percussione contrahant ali·

¹³ See Tyndall‚ Heat a Mode of Motion‚ 3rd ed, ξ 25: ‘When the air
is compressed, heat is suddenly generated. Tinder may be ignited by
this beat.¹ Compressed air, when expanded, on the other hand, has a
chilling effect.

¹⁴ This statement is perfectly true. Motion or mechanical force (which
always involves friction) and heat are mutually convertihle. Motion may
always be converted into heat, and heat into motion. This is the funda·
mental axiom of the modern science of Heat.

¹⁸ Mr. Ellis refers to Arist Meteorol. hle i. ch. 2 (ch. 3 of Berlin Edi·
tion, p 341a) sub finem, and De Coelo, ii. 7 (p. 288 a). The latter pas·
sage is peculiarly interesting: ἡ dr* θερμότης ἀπ’ αὐτῶν (seran ἄστρων) καὶ τὸ
φῶν γίνεται πορεκτριβομένου τοῦ ἆέρον ὑπὸ τῆς ἐκεῖνον φορᾶς. πέφυκε γὰρ ἡ
κίνησις ἐκπυροῦν soi ξύλα :allidens troi σίδηρον· εὐλογώτερον οὖν τὸ ἐγγύτερον
τοῦ πυρόν, ἐγγύτερον δὲ d ἆήρ, οἶον καὶ t'rrl τῶν φερομένων βολῶν· τοῦτο γὰρ
αὐτὰ ἐκπυροῦται οὕτως, enh. Mt. Ellis remarks that ‘it seems probahle
that Aristotle was intluenced by a wish to secure the doctrine of the
etemity of the universe, which he saw would be put in peril if celestia] heat
was ascribed to anything akin to combustion.'

That Aristotle's theory was not inherently impossible will be plain from
the following passage, talren from Tyndall's Heat a Mode of Motion, 3rd
ed„ ξ 12: ‘The most probable theory of shooting stars is that they are
small planetary bodies revolving round the sun, which are caused to swerve
from their orbits by the attraction of the earth, and are raised to incan-
descence by friction against our atmosphere. chladni propounded this
view, and Dr. Joule has shewn that the atmospheric friction is competent
to produce the effect' Professor Tyndall, at the beginning of this section,
refers to Aristotle’s statement that arrows are heated by passing through
the air.

¹⁶ This is so. A bullet or a caunos-hall is heated by passing through
