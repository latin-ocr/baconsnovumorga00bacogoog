REACTION AGAINST ARISTOTLE. 83

non perniciosius, exitiosius, calamitosius quicquam reperturum, quam
ab uno Aristotele repertum est.

Dii talem terris avertite pestem:

Quid est judicium, o domine Aristoteles, o unice naturae lili,0
deus amentium? sc. dormit genera judicii quot sunt? nondum e
somno excitatus est sed sortasse deus iste per sacerdotem, aut in-
terpretem aliquem loquitur. heus Aristotelei sacerdotes, quoniam deus
vester dormiens nos hic despicit, quid est judicium? quae sunt judicii
genera? '

We see from these quotations, which might be multiplied to almost

any extent, that the cautious criticism ol the earlier writers has t

degenerated into mere abuse, and that olten ol the most grossly
exaggerated kind.

Bacon in his sixteenth year (September 1576) was sent by his
father into F rance, in the train ol the English Ambassador, Sir Amias
Paulet There he resided, chiefly in Paris, till his lather's death in
March 1578-9 ⁹³. During these two years and a hall, he must have
heard much, and heard with curiosity and interest, ol the opinions
oi Ramus, ol the revolt against Aristotle, and of the hopes to be
entertained lrom the inauguration ol a new methodos enquiry and
from giving a new direction to scientific study. Hence, it is not
unlikely, as M. Barthelemy Saint-Hilaire ⁹⁴ suggests, that his sojourn
in Paris, where Ramism was then in the air, may have had acon-
siderable influence in determining the philosophical position which he
afterwards assumed.

At this time, the spirit ol revolt against Aristotle was everywhere in ι

the ascendant. Bemardiuo Telesio oi Cosenza (b. 1509, d. 1588), ,·
whom Bacon pronounced the ‘best ol the novellists,’ and to whom he
makes constant reference throughout his works, invariably criticises
Aristotle with the utmost lreedom. The reader who is curicus to
see the direction which this criticism takes, and the tone in which it is
conducted, may refer to the Prooemium to the two books ‘De Rerum
Natura juxta propria principia,' δια, and to the Dedication prefixed to
the nine books bearing the same title. In the latter writiug he says
of the Aristotelian philosophy: ‘et sensui, et sibi etiarn ipsi, quin et
Deo Opt. Max. passim repugnat! His tone, however, compared
with that ol Ramus, is unusually moderate and respectlul ⁹⁶.
