, he retained an unwavering saith in the existence of the Supreme God,
the creator and fashioner of the universe. The following well-known
sentences from the Essay on Atheism (published, it must be recol·

¹ leeted, in its corrected form by Bacon's own authority in 162 5, the

year before his death) express, 1 believe, the most sincere convictions
of his beart: ‘I had rather believe all the fables in the Legend, and
the Talmud, and the Alcoran, than that this universal frameis with·
outa mind. And therefore God never wrought miracle to convince
atheism, because his ordinary works convince it. It is true, that a
little philosophy inclineth man’s mind to atheism ; but depth in philo
sophy bringeth men's minds about to religion. For while the mind
of man looketh upon second causes scattered, it may sometimes rest
in them, and go no further 3 but when it beholdeth the chain of them,
confederata and linked together, it must needs fly to Providence and
Deity. Nay, even that school which is most accused of atheism
doth most demonstrate religion 3 that is, the school of Leucippus
and Democritus and Epicurus For it is a thousand times more
credible that four mutable elements, and one immutable fifth essence‚
duly and eternally placed, need no God, than that an army of infinite
small portions or seeds unplaced should have produced this order
and beauty without a divine marshal!

and. I cannot question that Bacon also accepted the doctrines of a
Divine Providence and a providential order of the world. They are,
in fact, implied in the above passage. But the student will do well
to read the more explicit statement on this subject, contained in De
Augmentis, ii. 11²³. This passage, which, in substance, occurs also
in the Advancement of [learning must have passed under Bacon’s
hands and received his final approval as late as 1622 or 162 3.

3rd. If we compare De Augmentis, lib. i. (E. and S., vol. i. pp. 483,
484), lib. iv. cap. 1. (p. 585), and lib. iv. cap.3 (pp. 605, 606), we
shall, l think, conclude that, while Bacon had no doubt as to the
immortality of the soul, he was, like sorne of the early fathers,
inclined to regard the belief as resting rather on a direct revelation
from God than on a necessary, or perhaps even legitimate, conclusion
of human reason ¹⁴.

²³ Cp. also the passage on the proper sphera of Natural Theology in De Aug-
mentis, tii. a: ‘Quocirca, quod sit Deus, quod rernm habenas tractet, quod summe
potens, quod sapiens et praescius, quod bonus, quod remunerator, qnod vindex, quod
adorandus, etiam ex operibus ejus demonstrari et evinci potest!

'¹ It is notable that in the chapter on Natural Theology, quoted in the last note,
he does not mention the doctrine of the Immortality of the Sonl, though he certainly
