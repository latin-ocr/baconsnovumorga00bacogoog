LIB. II. 23· 417

speciei, sunt instantiae Solitariae. Album enim et nigrum
marmoris, et maculae albi et purpurei in floribus garyophylli ³⁸,
conveniunt fere in omnibus praeter ipsum colorem. Unde
facile colligitur, colorem non multum rei habere cum naturis
alicujus corporis intrinsecis, sed tantum situm esse in positura
partium crassiori et quasi mechanica. Istae autem Instantr'ae
sunt Solitariaa quatenus ad discrepantiam. Utrunque autern
genus Instantias Solitarias appellare consuevimus3 aut
Ferr'nasil, sumpto vocabulo ab astronomis.

Inter praerogativas instantiarum, ponemus secundo loco
Instantius Migrantes⁴⁰. Eae sunt, inquibus natura inquisita

⁸⁸ More properly Caryophylla, from καρυόφυλλον. The name, with Bacon,
probably designatas pinks, camations‚ and cloves.

³⁹ Dr. Kitchin gives up this word iu despair. lhave little doubt that
Mr. Eitis is right ln his conjecture that it is used (possibly by an ac·
cidental substitution) for feralis, which is thus defined in the Lexicon
Mathematicum ol HieronymusVitalis, published at Paris in 1668: ‘F eralis,

apud Astronotnos dititur planeta, quando·fuerit in loco, ubi nunanpscppm

reliquis familiaritatem habet: quod quidem maximum est detrimentum,
et potissime attenditur in Luna, quae proinde iu eo casu appellatur
Agrestis, cursu vacua,’ dre.

‘Baton's “ travelling instances’' are those in which the natureor quality
under investigation “travels,’' or varies in degree; thus affording an
indIcation of a cause by a gradation of intensity in the effect. One of
his instantes is very happy, being that of ‘ paper, which is white when
dry, but proves less so when wet, and comes nearer to the state of
transparency upon the exclusion of the air, and admission of writer.
In reading this, and many other Instances in the Novum Organum, one
would almost suppose (had it been written) that its author had taken
them from N ewton's Optics.

‘The travelling instances‚ as well as what Becon terms “frontier in·
stances,” are cases in which we are enabled to trace that general law
which seems to pervade all nature-the law, as it is termed, os continuity,
which is expressed in the well-known sentence, “Natura non agit per
saltum.’'' Herschel, ἐξ 198,199.

Professor Playfair remarks: ‘The mineral kingdom is the great theatro
of the instantiae migrantes, where the same nature is seen in all grada-
tions, from the most perfect state, till it become entirely evanescent.
