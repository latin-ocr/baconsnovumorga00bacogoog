manner. Natura Naturata is the actual condition ofa given object or
quality, or of the aggregate of all objects and qualities, the Universe,
at any given time; Natura Naturans is the immanent cause of this con·
dition, or aggregate of conditions, and is regarded as producing it bya
continuous process. Thus, when we say ⁴ how wonderfully Nature works,'
we are speaking of ‘Natura Naturans;’ when we say ‘how beautiful is
Nature‚’ we are speaking of Natura Naturata. Hence, Natura Naturans
is related to Natura N aturata as cause to effect. Or, again, we may say
that Natura Naturane is the active or dynamical, Natura Naturata the
passive or statical aspect of Nature. It will be easily understood from this
account how Natura Naturaus, in some systems of philosophy, as, for
instance, in that of Spinoza, carne to denote God as the immanent cause
of the Universe.

In employing ‘natura naturans’ and ‘fons emanationis' as the equiva-
lents of ‘ form,' Bacon seems to be adopting a point of view slightly dif-
serent from that which he takes, where he describes itas ‘veradifferentia’
Eut, perhaps, we may exhibit the identity of these various expressions, by
saying that the ‘data natura' results from the ‘fonn’ in the same way
that the secondary properties flow from the primary (‘ differentia vera'),
or the attributes from the substance, or eflects in nature from the indwell-
ing cause. l am, however, inclined to think that in this passage the word
‘form’ is really employed, though, of course, unconsciously, with two dif-
ferent shades of meaning, namely, as the equivalent of ‘essence' (‘dif-
ferentia vera ') and of ‘ cause' (‘natura naturans, sive fons emanationis ⁹).
For an explanation of these two meanings, and an attempt at reconciling
them, see Introduction, ᾗ 8.

⁶ The idea of the transmutation of one body into another, and specially
of metals, is of frequent occurrence in Bacon's works, and is specially in-
sisted on in Liebig's invective against the Baconian philosophy. ‘The
possibilrly,’ says Mr. Ellis, ‘of transmutation, long and strenuously denied,
though certainly on no sufficient grounds, is now generally admitted.
“There was a time when this fundamental doctrine of the alchemists was
opposed to known analogies. It is now no longer so opposed to them,
only some stages beyond their present development.'' Taraday, Lectores
on Non-Metallic Elements, p. 106!

On Bacon's ideas as to the transmutability of the elements and of metals,
the student may refer to the Introduction, pp. 26-28.
