§2- ΟΝ ΤΗΕ OBJECT OF THE NOVUM ORGANUM.

Tira obJect of the Novum Organum, and oi Bacon’s philosophy
in general, is, stated summarily, to enlarge the dominion oi man,
‘Regnum Hominis' as he phrases it, by increasing his knowledge
oi Nature and his power over her operations. This end can only
be accomplished‚ he conceives, by freeing the mind from its salse
prejudices, especially its habit of blind submission to authority, and
thus bringing it iace to sace with the facts of Nature. But these facts
are themselves of little use, unless sifted, compared, and employed as
stepping·st0nes to generalisations from which other laets can be legiti-
mately deduced. Hence, the need oi a new method of Induction,
which shall not merely accumulate but select instances on certain
rational principles, draw legitimate inserences from them, and thus
guarantee the truth oi those first principles from which our deductive
reasoning proceeds. This more scientific iorni of Induction it is
more especially the aim oi the Novum Organum to supply, but,
previously to laying down any rules sor it or exempliiying its em-
ployment, it is necessary to insist on its importance, to free the
mind from those obstacles which might prevent it stom having
recourse to this assistance, to point out the sources oi our errors
in the past, and to shew what hopes may be conceived of the future.
The preliminary task is undertaken in Book 1. The formal ex-
position os the method begins in Book II, but the work, as left by
Bacon, is not completed

This briei summary may be useful to the student, and, therefore,
I place it at the head of the Introduction. But it appears to me
undecimble to expand it, as, otherwise, I should be anticipating the
words oi my author as well as rendering necessary several explana-
tions which would now needlessly delay and weary the render, but
which I shall offer from time to time, in their proper place, as the
work proceeds.
