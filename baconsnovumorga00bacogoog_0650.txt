ΠΒ. ΙΙ. 48. 563

perpetuo trepidant, et irrequiete se agant ⁶⁴, nec statu suo
contenta, nec ulterius ausa progredi. Talis invenitur motus
in corde et pulsibus animalium3 et necesse est ut sit in
omnibus corporibus, quae statu ancipiti ita degunt inter
commoda et incommoda, ut distracta liberare se tentent, et
denuo repulsam patiantur, et tamen perpetuo experiantur ⁰⁵.
(19) Sit Motus Decimus Nonus et postremus, motus ille cui
vix nomen motus competit, et tamen est plane motus. Quem
motum, Motum Decubitus ⁰⁰, sive Motum Exhorrentiae Motus,
vocare licet. Per hunc motum terra stat mole sua ⁶⁷, mo·
ventibus se extremis suis in medium3 non ad centrum

⁶⁴ The word ‘agant,’ which occurs in the F irst Edition, should be
replaced by ‘agunt’ as is done in the Second and Third Editions.

‘⁵ Cp. Historia Densi et Rari, E. and S.‚ vol. ii. p. 263: ‘Pulsus cordis
et arteriarum in animalibus fit per irrequietam dilatationem spirituum, et
receptum ipsorum, per vices? ln reading vague and sanciful passages like
these, we must recollect that Harvey did not begin to teach his theory ol
the circulation of the blood till 1619, and that it was not till 1628 that his
great treatise, the ‘Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in
Animalibus,’ was published. Bacon might, it is true, have derived more
precise views than those which he expresses from earlier writers, but there
was nothing specially to direct his attention to this subject.

The Tides and the astronomical phenomena oi N utation and Libration
might iumish appropriate instances oi the ‘Motus T repidationis.’

⁴⁶ Decubitus=lying away from, sc. motion. See F acciolati on decubo.
He quotes Fabius Pictor apud Aul. Gell. lib. x. cap. 15: ‘Pedes lecti, in
quo cubat [sc. Flamen Dialis], luto tenui circumlitos esse oportet: et de
eo lecto trinoctium continuum non decubat: neque in eo lecto cubare
alium ias est’ Decubitus might, however, simply mean ‘lying down,'
‘reclining’ ‘repose’ (Cp. decumbo.)

On Bacon’s vague and improper use ol the word ⁴ motion,’ see the first
note on this Aphorism. Here it cannot be rendered even by ‘process’ or
‘operatiom’ but we must resort to some word oi very wide meaning, such
as ‘tendency’ or ‘affection’ oi matter.

‘inertia' the property of which Bacon here speaks, is simply the inca-
pacity oi matter to change its own state of rest or motion. The obscure
notions ol Bacon and his contemporaries about motion pnevented them
from seeing that this property applies as much to the tendency ol a body
in motion to go ou moving as to that oi a body at rest to remain at rest.
For a briei account of the establishment oi the F irst Law os Motion (which
seems to have been first enunciated by Galileo in 1638), see Whewell’s
History ol the Inductive Sciences, vol. ii. bk. vi. ch. 2.

⁸² Bacon seems never weary os parading his beliel in the immobility ol

the earth.
