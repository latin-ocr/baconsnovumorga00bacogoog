INFLUENCE ΟΝ THE ROl'AL SOCIETV. 117

and collegiate, and not always running in the nariowuess of single
endeavours! Maclaurin, again, in his Account of Newton's Philo
sophical Discoveries (p. 61) says: ‘lt has been observed that

Mr. Boyle was born the same year that Lord Bacon died, as if he
had been destin’d to carry on his plan!

Ι come next to Dr. Robert Hookelb.1635, d. 1703), who suc·
ceeded Oldenburg as Secretary of the Royal society, and was
amongst the most distinguished of its early members. Amongst his
Posthumous Works is published one entituled The Present¹ State of
Natural Philosophy and the Method of Improving it, which is
described by Dr. Whewell as an ‘attempt to adapt the Novum
Organum to the age which succeeded its publication! The whole
of this treatise is in the lines of the Novum Organurn, and much of it
is a mere translation of its language. And yet Hooke seldom men-
’ tions Bacon, another proof out of many how little the writers of that
time think it necessary to cite by name the authors from whom they
borrow or to whom they are under obligations. In one place, how-
ever (Posthumous Works, p. 6), he announces his design as follows:
‘Some other course therefore must be taken to promote the Search of
Knowledge. Some other kind of Art for Enquiry thau what hath
hitherto been made use of, must be discovered ; the Intellect is not to
be suffered to act without its Helps, but is continually to be assisted
by some Method or Engine, which shall be as a Guide to regulate its
Actions, so as that it shall not be able to act amiss: Of this Engine‚
no Man except the incomparable Verulam hath had any thoughts,
and he indeed hath promoted it to avery good pitch ; but there is
yet somewhat more to be added, which he seemed to want time to
compleat’ Hooke¹s work, like its prototype‚ was unfinished.

Testimonies of this kind might easily be multiplied to almost any
extent. Such are those of John Evelyn, an early member of the
Royal Society, and celebrated as the author of Sylva, Numismata ³⁴,
the well-known Diary, &e ; of Dr.Joshua Childrey, who, in a letter to
Oldenburg, preserved by Antony Wood³⁵, says ‘he first fell in love
with the lord Bacon's philosophy in the year 1646,’ and who, in 1661,
published a work entitled ‘ Britannia Baconica, or the Natural Rarities

⁸⁴ There are constent allusione to Baeou in both these works, especially in the
former: see particularly Numismata, eh. 9. p. 3403 Sylva, Addroes to the Reader
(much enlarged in the 3rd Editiou).

’³ Wood's Athenae oxonienses, vol. iii. p. 904 (Ed. utin, 1817). According to
Wood, the Britannia Baconica, mentioned in the text, suggested to Dr. Plot his
Natural History of Oxfordshire.
