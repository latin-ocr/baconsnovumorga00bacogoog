illas in liquidis, per quas illa dum pressa sint, antequam se
liberare possunt, se invicem relevant, ut compressionem illam
ex aequo tolerent, motui libertatis verius assignamus.

⁸³ On the medium oi Light, cp. Topica Inquisitionis De Luce et
Lumine, x, xi (E. and S., vol. ii. p. 320), and Sylva Sylvarum, Exps. 761-2,
where he notices the phenomenonoi Refraction; on the medium oi Sound‚
tbe numerous ‘Experiments' on Sound in Sylva sylvarum, Centuries ii, iii ;
on the medium oi Heat, tbe numerous remarks scattered throughout this
Book oi the Novum Organum; and on the medium through which the
Magnet acts, the Inquisitio De Magnete (E. and S., vol ii. pp. 311-2), and
Nov. Org. ii. 42. His remarks on tbe transmission oi Heat are vitiated
throughout by bis not distinguishing between radiation 3ηά conduction.

One oi the most important differences with respect to transmission
through media is that, while heat and light can be transmitted in vacuo,
sounrl cannot. Moreover, the denser the air in which 3 sound is gene-
rated, the more intense is it A magnet will act in vacuo, but Faraday
bas shown that a substance, which is paramagnetic in vacuo, may become ·
diamagnetic in air. As respects electricity‚ 1 may quote the following
passage irom Ganot's Physics (12th Ed. oi Translation, § 927): ‘The
electrical discharge does not pass through a vacuum, as is shown by the
following experiment A small tube containing caustic potash is iused to
a Geisslers tube connected with aSprengel pump. By continual ex-
haustion while the caustic potash is being beated, as complete a vacuum
as possible is made oi the tube sealed. The last minute trace oi aqueous
vapour is absorbed by tbe caustic potash as it cools. ln this complete
vacuum the discharge, however strong, no longer passes; the vacuum
acts as 3 complete non-conductor)

⁸⁴ Tbis somewhat ianciiui notion, still more iancifully illustrated‚ re·
quires no comment. Better illustrations would have been, in respect oi
determining iunctions, the place oi the beart 3ηά brain in the animal
economy, or, in respect oi relative importance, that oi the seed-vessels
in plants. F or the metaphor, cp. Arist. Pol. i. 5 (6) : ἡμὶν γὰρ ψυχὴ τοῦ
σώματος ἄρχει δεσποτικὴν ἀρχὴν, ὁ di voris τῆς ὀρέξεως πολιτικὴν καὶ βασιλικήν,
eal.
