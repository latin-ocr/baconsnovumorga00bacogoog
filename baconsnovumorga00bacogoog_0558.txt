LIB. II. 46. 529

maris; rotante terra velocius, aquis tardius; ideoque accumu-
lantibus se aquis in sursum, et deinde per vices se remittentibus
in deorsum, ut demonstratur in vase aquae incitatius movente.
Sed hoc commentus est concesso non concessibili⁴² (quod
terra nempe moveatur), ac etiam non bene informatus ⁴³ de
oceani motu sexhorario.

At exemplum hujus rei de qua agitur, videlicet, de compa·
rativis mensuris motuum, neque solum rei ipsius, sed et usus
insignis ejus (de quo paulo ante loquuti sumus), eminet in
cuniculis subterraneis, in quibus collocatur pulvis pyrius; ubi
immensae moles terrae, aedificiorum, et similium, subvertuntur,
et in altum jaciuntur, a pusilla quantitate pulveris pyrii⁴⁴.
Cujus causa pro certo illa est, quod motus dilatationis pulveris,
qui impellit, multis partibus sit pernicior, quam motus gravi·
tatis perquem fieri possit aliqua resistentia3 adeo ut primus
motus perfunctus sit, antequam motus adversus inceperit3 ut
in principiis nullitas quaedam sit resistentiae. Hinc etiarn fit,
quod, in omni missili, ictus, nontam robustus quam acutus et
, celer, ad perlationem potissimum valeat. Neque etiam fieri
potuisset, ut parva quantitas spiritus animalis ⁴⁵ in animalibus,

explanation. That the earth's being in motion might be the cause of the
tides, had been suggested before the time of Galileo by Caesalpinus in the
Quaestiones Peripateticae, iii. 5. It is odd that Patricius, in giving an
account of all the theories which had in his time been devised to explain
the cause of the tides (see his Pancosmia‚ l. 28), does not mention
Caesalpinus', though it was published some years before his own work.
Galileo perhaps alludes to Caesalpinus in his letter to Cardinal Orsino,
dated 8th January‚ 1616. See, for remarks on Caesalpinus’ doctrine, the
Problemata hiarina of Casmann, published in 1596. Casmann’s own
theory is that of expansion’ Mr. Ellis’ note. See also my notes on
Aph. 36 (1). Galileo’s Theory of the Tides will be found stated at length
in his Dialogo dei Massimi Sistemi, Giornata Quarta.

⁴² See note 37 above on this subject. In the present passage, Bacon
may mean nothing more than that Galileo assumed what required to be
proved.

⁴³ See the passage on the Tides in Aph. 36 (1).

⁴⁴ In describing Blasting, as Dr. Kitchin observes, Bacon confuses the
resistance of inertia with the force of gravity. There is in these cases no
‘anticipation of motion,’ ‘anteversio motus,’ as Bacon calls it here and in
Aph. 51.

⁴⁵ On Bacon’s curious conception of ‘ Spirit,’ cp. Aph. 40 and the other
passages referred to in the notes on that Aphorism,
