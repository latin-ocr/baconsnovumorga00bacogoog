notatae sint ⁸⁶. Quinetiam trabes et columnae lucidae et
chasmata⁸⁷ et similia apparent saepius temporibus hybernis
quarn aestivis ⁸⁸ ; et maxime per intensissima frigora, sed con·
juncta cum siccitatibus. Fulmina tamen et coruscationes et
tonitma raro eveniunt hyeme, sed sub tempus magnorum
fervorum⁸⁹. At stellae (quas vocant) cadentes existimantur
vulgo magis constare ex viscosa aliqua materia splendida et

adsentior: non enim existimo cometen subitaneum ignem, sed inter
aeterna opera naturae.' (Chaps. 21, 22.) A view somewhat similar to
the former was regarded as possible even by Galileo. See ll Saggiatore,
20', dre, where he defends, as a possible explanation of comets, the
theory that they are formed by exhalations from the earth, rising to a
great height and reflecting the light of the Sun. The return of Halley’s
Comet, nearly at the time predicted by him, in 1759, conclusively proved
that these bodies belong to the solar, and not to the terrestrial system,
and that, in the words of Seneca, they are ‘aeterna opera naturae.'

⁸⁸ N either the one effect nor the other, so far as I am aware, has ever
been established by meteorologieal observation. Ar the same time, it
would be rash to deny that comets might have either or both of these
effects, especially if it be true, as the most recent spectrum analysis
seems to shew, that ‘the nucleus is self-luminous, and that it is very
possibly composed of glowing gas containing carbon! See a most
interesting section on Comets and their Spectra in Dr. Schellen¹s Spec-
trum Analysis, translated by J. and C. Lassell, and edited by Dr. Huggins
(Longmans, 1872).

θ’ For ‘trabes' see Seneca's Natural Questions, i. 1, vii. 4, 5; for
‘columnae flagrantes,' vii. 203 and for ‘ chasmata,' i. 14. As Dr. Kitchin
y observes, they are all os them clearly names for different appearances of
the Aurora Borealis, unless we suppose that ‘columnae clipeique fla·
grantes' may stand for the Zodiaoal Light.

⁸⁸ This statement is not quite accurate. The annual maxima of these
appearances are, taking an average, in March and October, the latter
being the greater3 and the annual minima in June and January. Whether
the Aurora be an electrical phenomenon (as most meteorologists sup-
pose), or whether (as some suppose) it be a cloud ol meteorie dust ignited
by friction with the atmosphere, there is nothing to connect it with the
rate of temperatura.

It is, of course, only on clear nights that the phenomenon can be seen,
and such nights are generally cold.

⁸⁰ This statement is generally, though not universally, true. As aerial
electricity is, in all probability, mainly due to evaporation, and this
process occurs to a much greater extent in hot weatber than in cold,
there is a good reason why thunder·storms should be more frequent in
summer than in winter.
