⁸⁸ 1 think that Bacon must here have in mind cosmiml clouds, in thr
interstellar spaces, not ordinary or aerial clouds. The argument is tha·
the light of the stars, if it took a long time for its transmission, would br
frequently stopped by various obstacles in the sky, whereaS, on a cleu
night, we invariably see the stars where we expect to find them. At the
same time, it must be confessed that, if there were such obstacles as 1 arr
supposing Bacon to contemplate, the light might sometimes be interoepet
however instantaneous its transmission. There is, theu, an undoubtei
difficulty in the passage, though it does not appear to me so great asir ³
seems to appear to Mr. Spedding.

³⁹ The retention of images on the retina of the eye is a familiar pheno
menon, of which the reader will easily supply himself with instances. The
duration of the persistence varies with the intensity of the light and the
sensitiveness of the organ. ‘M. Plateau has investigated the duration of
the impression by numerous methods, and has found that it is on the
average half a second. n s ι Α great number of pieces of apparatus are
founded on the persistence of sensation on the retina. Such are the
thaumatrope, the phenakistoscope, Faraday's wheel, the kaleidopbone,
and the zoetrope.’ Ganots Physics, rath Ed, ξ 625.

⁴⁰ Mt. Ellis says that ‘in the case of vibrating strings Bacon’s explana-
tion is not altogether complete. The distinctor quasi-distinct images to
which he refers correspond to limiting positions of the vibrating string.’

⁴¹ ‘This account of Galileo's theory of the tides is inaccurate ln this
theory the tides are caused by the varying velocity of different points of
the earth’s surface‚ arising from the composition of the earth's tvo
motions, namely that about its axis, and that in its orbit. Bacon does not
seem to have perceived that both these motions are essential to the
