Quae adhuc inventa sunt in scientiis, ea hujusmodi sunt, ut

notionibus vulgaribus fere subjaceant: ut vero ad interiora et
remotiora naturae penetretur, necesse est ut tam notiones
quarn axiomata magis certaet munita via a rebus abstra-
hantur, atque omnino melior et certior intellectus adoperatio

in usum veniat.

²² lt should be noticed that even the falsest and flimsiest generalisations
about Nature rest upon some slight basis of fact. After observing a few
particulars, Bacon complains, men usually ily off to the widest gene-
ralisations, and then acquiesce in these, as if they were so rnany indubitable
truths. But, in considering this frequent source of error, he does not per-
ceive that rapid generalisation is often indispensable to the scientific
enquirer. The fault does not consist so much in making rapid gene-
ralisations as in acquiescing too readily and confidently in thern, when
made. The method of gradual and continuous ascent from particulare
to the highest axioms, through all the intermediate steps, which is here
commended by Bacon‚ is not the method which, for the most part, has
been actually pursued by the most successful investigators of Nature, nor
would its general adoption contribute to the advancement of science.
Providedahypothesisberegarded simplyasahypothesis, and not assumed
as true without a rigorous investigation, the mere fact of its generality
ought to be no objection to it. lndeed, by stimulating enquiry and
directing its course, it is plain that a very general hypothesis, such as
the theory of universal gravitation, or Laplace's nebular hypothesis, or
the ware-theory of light and sound, or the theory of evolution, or the
theory oi final causes, even in its cruder forms, may, whether ultimately
proved to be true or false, be of the utmost service iu the investigation
even of small groups of facts The all-important proviso, of course, is
that, tr'llproved, such a hypothesis must be taken simply quantum valeat,
as a hypothesis and no more. 1r would be far from an advantage to
science, to restrain the flights of scientific imagination, but the products
of imagination must never be confounded with the results of proof. The
fantastic character of the Ancient Physics was due far less toan exuberant
imagination than to a defective sense of evidence And the true remedy
was to insist on the necessity of verification rather than on the suppression
of hypothesis.

There is, therefore, a third way of investigation which is not open to
Bacon’s animadversione and which is peculiarly the way of genius. lt
begins, like the other two, with the observation of particulare, for this
always is and must be the first step, and then, by an effort of imagination,
frames for itself some explanation which has a far wider range of appli-
cation than the special class of phenomena which has been observed.
