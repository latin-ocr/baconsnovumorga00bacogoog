Neque rursus cogitari potest quomodo aeternitas defluxerit

ι ad hunc diem; cum distinctio illa, quae recipi consuevit, quod

sit infinitum a parte ante et a parte post, nullo modo constare
possit; quia inde sequeretur, quod sit unum infinitum alio
infinito majus, atque ut consumatur infinitum, et vergat ad
finitum ⁷². Similis est subtilitas de lineis semper divisibilibus,
ex impotentia cogitationis. At majore cum pernicie inter·
venit haec impotentia mentis in inventione causarum: nam
cum maxime universalia in natura positiva ⁷³ esse debeant,

Sir W. Hamilton's Lectures on Metaphysics, Lecture 38; Mr. Mill’s
Examination ol Hamilton, ch. 6; and, lastly, as a desence ot' Sir W.
Hamilton and a reply to Mr. Mill, Dr. Mansel’s ‘ Philosophy os the Con·
ditioned.¹ The student of Kant will derive great assistance from consult-
ing, on this subject, the work ol Mr. Caird on ‘The Philosophy ol Kant,’
pt. ii. chs. 16. 17. lt must be recollected‚ however, that Mr. Caird's
criticisnrs ol Kant, and the extensione which he endeavours to give to Kant’s
philosophy, are made entirely from the Hegelian stand-point. Much of
the difficulty and confusion experienced in dealing with these questions
would be avoided, il the student could keep clearly before his mind the
laet that the term ‘infinite' simply expresses the negation ol ‘finite'
For ‘that alone‚' says Locke, ‘is infinite, which has no bounds; and that
the Idea os Infinity, in which our thoughts can find none! And again,
that is an infinite space or number ‘which, in a constant and endless
inlarging and progression, the mind can in thought never attain to.'
Essay, bk. ii. ch. 17. § 8.

⁷² Bacon’s criticism is unfortunate and could only arise lrom his
ignorance ol mathematies. ln reasoning on ‘infinities,' it is a first
principle that the addition or subtraction oi any finite quantity, however
large, may, in comparison with infinity, be neglected. oe ἑτι = oc. This
formula is entirely independent of the value which we assign to a, pro-
vided it be finite.

With regard to the distinction between infinitum a parte ante and in-
finitum a parde post, it seems to me that it is not only perlectly legi-
timam, but that it suggests the only way in which the mind can attempt
to picture to itselr' either infinity ol time or infinity oi space. We
mentally take our position at some particular point or moment, usually the
present, and try to conceive of an endless regress or an endless progress,
as the case may be, from that point or moment. The endless progress is
the infinitum a parte anre, the endless regress the infinitum a partepart.

⁷³ This passage is obscure, but its meaning appears to be that there
are certain great laws ol nature, or causes, or, as Bacon would probably
have said, ‘torma' in which we ought to acquiesce as ultimate expla-
nations ol laets. Such, to take instances from modern science. may,
perhaps, be the law of gravity, the law ol inertia, and the laws ol chemical
combination. Now Bacon can hardly mean that these laws, causes, or
