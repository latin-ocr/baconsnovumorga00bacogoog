Causa vero et radix sere omnium malorum in scientiis ea
una est3 quod dum mentis humanae vires salso miramur et
extollimus, vera ejus auxilia non quaeramus.

Subtilitas naturae subtilitatem sensus et intellectus multis

⁹ Dr. Kitchin bere very appositely quotes Aristotle, Metaph. α. 1.
'leucii καὶτῆς χαλεπότητος οὔσης κατὰ δύο τρύπανα, οὐκ ἐν τοῖς πράγμασιν,
ἀλλ’ ἐν ἡμῖν τὸ αἴτιον αὐτῆς. Ὠσπερ γὰρ καὶ τὰ τῶν νυκτερίδων ὄμματα πρὸς τὸ
φέγγος ἔχει τὸ μεθ’ ἡμέραν, οὕτωκαὶ τῆς ἡμετέρας ψυχῆς ὁ ναῦς πρὸς τὰ τῇ
φύσει φανερώτατα πάντων.

. Το the same effect we find a passage in Galileo’s Dialogo dei Massimi

Sistemi‚ Giornata Prima (sir Thomas Salusbury’s Translation, pp. 84, 85) :

Sagredur. ‘l ever accounted extraordinary madness that oi those who
would make human comprehension the measure ol what nature hath a
power or knowledge to effect3 whereas on the contrary there is not any
the least effect in Nature, which can be fully understood by the rnost
speculative wits in the world. This their so vain presumption oi knowing
all can take beginning from nothing, unless from their never having known
anything; sor il one bath but once only experienced the perfect knowledge
oi one only thing, and but truly tasted what it is to know, he shall perceive
that oi infinite other conclusions he understands not so much as one.¹

¹⁰ A post-classical word. ‘Controversies’ Du Cange explains itas
‘Lis, controversia, placitum’ and, amongst otherauthorities, quotes Gregor.
Magn. lib. i. epist. 9: ‘F ines, de quibus causatio mota est ;’ Concilium
Arelatense, an. 813. can. 16 ε ‘Ne in Dominicis diebus publicae mercatae,
neque causationes disceptationesque exerceantur.¹

The word occurs in the sense os an ‘excuse' or ‘apology’ as early
as the time ol Aulus Gellius (⁴ Atque id iecerunt ne causatio ista aegri
corporis perpetuam vacationem daret fidem detrectantibus, jurisque ac-
tiones declinantibus‚’ Noctes Atticae, lib. nor. cap. 1), but that does not
seem to be its meaning in this place.

¹¹ We cannot place ourselves sufficiently apart from the crowd in which
we move, to obtain anything like an adequate idea os· its eccentricities
and delusions.

²¹ Aphorisms xi—xiv should be considered in connexion with each

other. They contain the sum oi Bacon's complaint against the old logie. '

Though the scholastic logie recognised Induction as a fonn ol reasoning,
