motus communi et inveterata opinione habetur pro proprio
coelestium. Attamen gravis de illo motu lis est inter non-
nullos tam ex antiquis quam modemht, qui rotationem terrae
attribuerunt. At multo sortasse justiorlo movetur controversia
(si modo res non sit omnino extra controversiam), an motus

videlicet iste (concesso quod terra stet) coeli finibus conti·
neatur, an potius descendat, et communicetur ae'ri et aquis ³¹.
Motum autem rotationis in missilibus, ut in spiculis, sagittis,
pilis sclopetorum‚ et similibus, omnino ad motum libertatis
rejicimus ⁶².

(18) Sit Motus Decimus Octavus, Motus T repedationis, cui
(ut ab astronomis intelligitur) non multum fidei adhibemus ⁶³.
Nobis autem corporum naturalium appetitus ubique serio
perscrutantibus occurrit iste motus 3 et constitui debere videtur
inspeciem. Est autem hic motus veluti aeternae cujusdam
captivitatis. Videlicet ubi corpora non omnino pro natura
sua bene locata, et tamen non prorsus male se habentia,

to circular motion, that is, unless we reject the sixth and seventh species
ol vat-latium it will not be necessary lot us to suppose the poles themselves
to he movable: in other words, that the phenomena oi which we could
by this hypothesis give an account may be adequately represented without
it by means ol spirals’

⁶⁰ This language, the reader will perceive‚ exactly accords with what
we have so olten elsewhere found to be Bacou’s opinion not only as to the
annual, but also as to the diumal motion oi the earth.

⁸³ ‘The name oi trepidation was given by the Alphonsine astronomers
to a motion by which they imagined the starry heaven to be affected, and
in virtue oi which its equinoxes described small circles ol nine degrees
radius about those oi the ninth or next superior orb. To account ior this
motion they introduced a tenth orb. The phenomenon, however, thus
accounted lor was altogether imaginem, although it is true that the length
ol the tropical year, by supposed variations os which the idea ol trepi-
tion was suggested, is not rigorously constant. lt may be questioned
whether Bacon’s hesitation to accept the astronomical motion oi trepi-
dation had any better foundation than his doubts whether the proper
motions ol the planetary orbs were anything more than “res confictae et
suppositae.'' [See Aph. 36 (2).] The question os the existence
or non-existence oi trepidation could only be decided by a person
eonversant with the details oi the received system ol astronomy.³ Mt.
