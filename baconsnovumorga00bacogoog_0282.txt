Lm. J. 67. 253

physica sunt genera motuum. At illa altera plane logica
sunt et scholastica, ut ex hac collatione eorum manifesto
liquet.

Neque minus etiarn malum est, quod in philosophiis et
contemplationibus suis, in principiis rerum atque ultimatibus
naturae investigandis et tractandis opera insumatur; curn
omnis utilitas et facultas operandi in mediis consistat ⁵⁷.
Hinc fit, ut abstrahere naturam homines non desinant, donec
ad materiam potentialem et informem ⁶⁸ ventum fuerit3 nec
rursus secare naturam desinant, donec perventum fuerit ad
atomum; quae, etiamsi vera essent, tamen ad juvandas
hominum fortunas parum possunt ⁶⁹.

. Danda est etiam cautio intellectui de intemperantiis philo·

may be in amount. On the supposed substance Phlogiston, which was
regarded as essentially light, and the reasoning by which its existence
bas been disproved, see Herschel’s Discourse on the Study of Natural
Philosophy, ᾗ 336. The notion of absolute levity is connected with that
of natural motion, discussed under note 53 on this Aphorism.

n The fiitb and last error under this head consists in the neglect of
intennediate axioms, and the excessive attention paid to the principles
of things and the ultimate constitution of nature. Cp. Aph. 104, where
this idea is still further expanded. lt is undoubtedly true that the practical
applications of science are usually deduced from axiomata media ratherthan
from the highest generalisations, but these last are, at the same time,
indispensable to the complete constitution of a science. To be of scien·
tific value, however, they must not be mere intellectuat abstractions, but
duly based on facts and capable of verification, ‘talia scilicet, quae non
abstracta sint, sed per haec media vere limitantur!

⁵⁸ The ὕλη of the Greek Philosophers.

⁶⁹ This remark is hardly consistent with Bacon's frequent praise of
Democritus, or with the importance which be attaches to the discovery
of the latens processus and the latens schematismos (see especially uk. ii.
Apbs. 6—9).

From a full consideration of the various passages in which he allodes
to, or discusses the question, l am of opinion that Bacon, while adopt·
ing the atomic theory as to the ultimate constitution of matter, rejected
the vacuum by which the minute particles were supposed to be separated,
as well as the eternal, rigid and anchangeable character ascribed to the
particles or atoms themselves. Hence the varying terms in which he
speaks of Democritus. See my notes on i. 63, ii. 8 ad init, ii 48 (a), and
ii. 48 (conclusion).
