108 INTRODUCTION.

decrease with days since, but rather increase. Divers of his works
have·been anciently and yet lately translated into other tongues, both
learned and modern, by foreign pens.¹

Further evidence of the 'same lact is lurnished by Bacon's cora
respondence with two distinguished Italian ecclesiastica, Father
Baranzan and F ather Fulgentio. Bacon's very interesting letter to the
former, who was a young professor of mathematics and philosophy
at Annecy irr Savoy, was preserved by J. P. Niceron in his Memoires,
and is reproduced by Mr. Spedding in his seventh volume oi Bacon’s
Life 3ηά Letters, pp. 374-378. Baranran’s letter, which called forth
this response, is unfortunately not extant With Father Fulgentio,
who, according to Archbishop Tenison“, was ‘a Divine (if 1 mis-
take not) ol the Republic oi Venice, and the same who wrote
the Lite oi his Colleague, the excellent Father Paul,’ passed at least
one interchange oi letters. Here, again, the letter oi Fulgentio is
unfortunately lost, but Bacon's reply is given in Tenison's Baconiana
(pp. 196-200), and in the seventh volume of Spedding's Liie and
letters oi Bacon, pp. 5 31-5 33.

Attention is drawn by Mr. Napier to acurious and interesting
letter from Toby Matthew to Bacon, dated Brussels, April 4, 1619 ⁸⁸,
in which he connects the name of Bacon with that oi Galileo. ‘It

may please your Iordship, there was with me this day one Mr.
Richard White, who hath spent some little time at F lorence, and is

now gone into England. He tells me, that Galileo had answered
your discourse concerning the flurr and rellux of the sea, and was
sending it unto me; but that Mr. White lrindered him, because his
answer was grounded upon a salse supposition, namely, that there
was irr the ocean a full sea but once in twenty-four hours. But now
Iwill call upon Galileo again.¹ As the tract De Fluxu et Refluxu
Maris was not published till it was included in Gnrter's collection
ol 1653, it must have been communicated to Galileo in manuscript,
thus shewing the interest already taken in Bacon’s writings. It is
true, 1 believe, that Galileo makes no mention of Bacon's worlrs,
but then, as Ι shall presently have occasion to remark, and as we
have already seen in the case os Locke, the habitos referring to
contemporary or recent writers was at this time comparatively
rare.
