particulares, earumque series et ordines, recurrere; ut mox
dicemus, quum ad modum et rationem constituendi notiones
et axiomata deventum fuerit.

for the purpose of explaining the most important distinctions which we
either find obtruded on our notice, or think it desirable to establisb.
Moreover, these definitions, when constructed, donot pretend to represent
concrete facts but only certain abstract relations of figures and numbers.
That such relations exist, if not strictly, at least approximately, no one
disputes3 they can generally be expressed inafew words, which adequately
and exhaustively represent them, anda single technical term is easily
invented or appropriated, by means of which the definition can in future
be summoned before the mind. About the adequacy or correctness of
these definitions there is seldom any difference of opinion, and, even if
there be, it does not affect the validity of the subsequent reasoning; for,
provided that the same relation be invariahly designated by the same
name, and that the logical operations be correctly performed, there can
be no error in the result. But, when we come to deal with the complex
relations of nature and life, it is widely different. Here, Induction occu-
pies a far more important place, and, till we have ascertained, distinguished,
and classified the more important properties of the objects under investi-
galion, it is in vain to begin the work of Definition. It is only aiter
we have completed the inductiva stage of the enquiry that we are in a
position to draw upa list of definitions, or, if we venture to do so before,
we ought to regard them simply as incomplete and provisional‚ and hold
ourselves in constant readiness to review and correct them. Hence,
while the inductive stage of a science is progressive, and therefore,
incomplete‚ it is natural that much controversy should turn on the
definitions. ‘It is necessary,' as bacon says, ‘to be constantly recurring
to particular instances,' and we cannot safely reason deductively from
the definitions as data, till we have firmly established the inductions on
which they rest, and of which they are frequently the expressions, and,
indeed, the summaries.

On the nature and place of Definition in Mathematics‚ the student may
referto Dugald Stewart's Section, entitled ‘Of Mathematical Demon-
stration,' in the Philosophy of the Human Mind (Hamilton’s Ed.,v01. ii.
pp. 113-152), and Mill’s Logia bk. ii. chs. 5, 6; and on the distinction
between ‘F inal and Complete’ and ‘Incomplete and Provisional' Defi-
nitions, to the Editor¹s chapter on Definitions in his Elements of De-
ductive Logic.
