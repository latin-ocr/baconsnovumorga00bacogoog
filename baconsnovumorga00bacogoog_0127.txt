versions even of those who were equally ready to give play to their
own imagination But, sofar as I can ascertain, no one had yet
pronounced himself even on these topics with so much point and
force, or ina manner so we'll calculated to lay hold of the popular
sympathy, as Bacon3 while, with respect to the fertile conception of
ascientific and methodical process of induction, as opposed to that
then in vogue, I have found nothing in any previous writer which
can properly and fairly be said to be an anticipation of the sug«
gestions so abundantly scattered throughout the Novum Organum.
To these conclusions I shall hereafter revert in another section, that
on the Present Value of Bacon's Logical Works.

cedit per Inductionem, omnia complectitur? (Nou. Org. i. 127.)

We may, therefore, conveniently divide the subject of this section by
asking, rst‚ what was the influence of Bacon’s Reform on Philosophy
(under which head 1 include all enquiries into the grounds, conditions‚
and character of human knowledge and human practice), and and, what
was its influence on Science (a word which I take in its modern
sense, as restricted to enquiries into the constitution and modes of
action of corporeal objects).

With respect to the first question, 1 can only state strongly my

and moralists, and, through them, a most important school of Euro
