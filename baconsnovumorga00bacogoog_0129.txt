100 INTRODUCTION.

in its spirit, and in its method. In the eyes of many this may be
areproach, but, il it be true as a lact, it will go lar towards estab
lishing a conclusion as to the influence ol Bacon over, at least, one
large department ot' investigation.

Before leaving this branch of our subject, it is only sair to mention
one very peculiar circumstance connected with it Hobbes had, in
early life, been Bacon's secretam, but, though he wrote a work ex-
pressly on ‘Computation or Iogiq' there is no mention initos
Induction¹¹, of the Baconian method, or os Bacon himself. It is,
perhaps, still more singular that there is no mention of Bacon in
the Epistle Dedicatory to the Elementa oi Philosophy (Molesworth’s
Edition‚ English Works, vol. i. ad init), where he refers to Galileo,
Kepler, Harvey, Gassendi‚ Mersenne, &c Bacon’s name, in fact, so
lar as Ι am aware, occurs only twice in the whole os Hobbes’ works,
and there without any epithet of praise or blame (see Problemata
Physica, Molesworth's Edition‚ latin Works, vol. iv. p. 3173 De·
mmeron Physiologicum‚ English Worlrs, vol. vii. p. 112). From the
extentos Hobbes' writings and the intimate personal relations which
had formerly existed between him and Bacon, ‘I can hardly refer
this silence to mere accident. It may have been due to some per·
sonal pique‚ or the abstract character of Hobbes' mind may have
rebelled against the concrete and inductive spirit ol Bacon's philo-
Ι sophy. For it may be noticed that there are few writers on moral
and political questions in whose works the historical spirit is more
conspicuously absent than in Hobbes.

De Remusat draws attention to the silence of Lord Herbert ol
Cherbury, but the whole bent oi his genius was so different from that
os Bacon, that this lact is hardly surprising.

Spinoza‚ in a letter written in 1661 (Bmders Ed„ vol. ii. p. 146,
’ Ep. ii), has some interesting remarks on Bacon, Having been asked
his opinion on Bacon and Descartes‚ he objects to them, firstly‚ ‘quod
tam longe acognitione primae causae et origine omnium rerum aber-
rarint 5’ secondly, ‘quod veram naturam humanae mentis non cogno
verint ς’ thirdly‚ ‘quod veram causam erroris nunquam assecuti sint'
ζ He then proceeds to criticise Bacon's Idola Tribus. In Ep. 4²

¹⁵ De Remnsat, whose remarks ou Hobbes (pp. 405-408) seem to me very just ancl
interesting, says that, to the best ol his belles, the word Induction occurs only once
in Hobbes’ writings. This mention os it is in a mathematical controversy with
Wallis (Molesworth’s Ed, Latin Works, vol. iv. p. 179), where be says in a spirit
the very reverse os Baconlan: ‘ Inductio autem demonstratio non est, nisi ubi par-
ticularia omnia enumerantur, qood hic est impossibile!
