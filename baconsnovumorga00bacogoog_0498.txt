et refluxus ille assignari debeat, oritur dubitatio. Quod si
recipiatur prior assertio, necesse est ut cum sit fluxus in mari
ex una parte, fiat sub idem tempus alicubi in mari refluxus
exalia. Itaque ad hoc reducitur inquisitio. Atqui observavit
Acosta, cum aliis nonnullis (diligenti facta inquisitione), quod
ad litora Floridae et ad litora adversa Hispaniae et Africae
fiant fluxus maris ad eadem tempora, et refluxus itidem ad
eadem tempora3 non contra, quod cum fluxus fit ad littora
Floridae‚ fiat refluxus ad littora Hispaniae et Africae ⁸⁰.
Attamen adhuc diligentius attendenti, non per hoc evincitur
motus attollens, et abnegatur motus in progressu. Fieri enim
potest, quod sit motus aquarum in progressu, et nihilominus
inundet adversa littora ejusdem alvei simul; si aquae scilicet
illae contrudantur et compellantur aliunde, quemadmodum
fit in fluviis, qui fluunt et refluunt ad utrumque littus horis
iisdem, cum tamen iste motus liquido sit motus in progressu,

Telesius and Patricius, compares the sea to the water in a caldron ς that is
to say, it rises and tends to boil over when its natural heat is called forth
under the influence of the sun, moon, and stars, and then after a while
subsides! On this, and the other curious theories by which the action of
the tides was explained by Bacon’s predecessore and contemporaries, see
the very interesting preface, prefixed by Mr. Ellis to the Tract De F luxu
et Refluxu Maris, Bacon’s Works, vol. iii. pp. 39-46.

To this Preface and to some good account of the theory and phe·
nomena of the tides, such as may be found in the Eucyo'opaedia Bri-
tannica the student must be, once for all, referred for further iufonnation
on this subject. lt would be a waste of labour to attempt here to criticise
or correct Bacon’s remarks iu detail. lt may be sufficient to state gener-
ally that he confounds throughout currents and derivative tides with tides
proper.

With what Bacon says on the tides in this Aphorism‚ we should compare
the passage in Aph. 35, and also that on the phenomena ot spring and
neap tides in Aph. 45, referred to in note 77 above. See also my notes on
both these passages.

‘⁰ Mr. Ellis says: ‘l have not been able to find this statement in Acosta‚
who speaks of the synchronism of the tides on the opposite sides of South
America, as shewn by the meeting of the tidal waves in the Straits of
Magellan (iii. 14).' F or further information on the observations and
theories of Acesta, see Mt. Ellis’ Preface to the De Fluxu et Refluxu
Maris, vol. iii. pp. 45-6.
