perpetuo trepidant, et irrequiete se agant ⁶⁴, nec statu suo
contenta, nec ulterius ausa progredi. Talis invenitur motus
in corde et pulsibus animalium; et necesse est ut sit in
omnibus corporibus, quae statu ancipiti ita degunt inter
commoda et incommoda, ut distracta liberare se tentent, et
denuo repulsam patiantur, et tamen perpetuo experiantur ⁶⁵.

( 19) Sit Motus Decimus Nonus et postremus, motus ille cui
vix nomen motus competit, et tamen est plane motus. Quem
motum, Motum Decubitus ⁶⁶, sive Motum Exhorrentiae Motus,
vocare licet. Per hunc motum terra stat mole sua ⁶⁷, mo-
ventibus se extremis suis in medium; non ad centrum

“The word ‘agant,' which occurs in the First Edition, should be
replaced by ‘agunt' as is done in the Second and Third Editions.

‘³ Cp. Historia Densi et Rari, E. and S., vol. ii. p. 263 ε ‘Pulsus cordis
et arteriarum in animalibus fit per irrequietam dilatationem spirituum, et
receptum ipsorum, per vices? ln reading vague and iancilul passages like
these, we must recollect that llarvey did not begin to teach his theory ol
the circulation of the blood till 1619, 3ηά that it was not till 1628 that his
great treatise, the ‘Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in
Animalibus,' was published. Bacon might, it is true, have derived more
precise views than those which he expresses t'rom earlier writers, but there
was nothing specially to direct his attention to this subject.

The Tides and the astronomical phenomena of Nutation and Libration
might furnish appropriate instances ol the ‘Motus Trepidationis.'

‘⁶ Decubitus=lying away from, se motion. See Facciolati on decubo.
lle quotes Fabius Pictor apud Aul. Gell. lib. x. cap. 15: ‘Pedes lecti, in
quo cubat [sc. Flamen Dialis], luto tenui circumlitos esse oportet: et de
eo lecto trinoctium continuum non decubat: neque in eo lecto cubare
alium las est! Decubitus might, however, simply mean ‘lying down,’
‘reclining,’ ‘repose.' (Cp. decumbo.)

On Bacon’s vague and improper use olthe word ‘motion,’ see the first
note on this Aphorism. Here it cannot be rendered even by ‘process’ or
‘operatiom’ but we must resort to some word os very wide meaning, such
as ‘tendency’ or ‘affection' of matter.

‘laertia' the property os which Bacon here speaks, is simply the inca-
pacity ol matter to change its own state of rest or motion. The obscure
notions oi Bacon and his contemporaries about motion prevented them
t'rom seeing that this property applies as much to the tendency of a body
in motion to go on moving as to that ol a body at rest to remain at rest.
Fora hriel account ol the establishment ol the First Law of Motion (which
seems to have been first enunciated by Galileo in 1638), see Whewell’s
ilistory ol the Inductive Sciences, vol. ii. bk. vi. ch. 2.

⁸⁷ Bacon seems never weary os parading his belief in the immobility ol
the earth.
