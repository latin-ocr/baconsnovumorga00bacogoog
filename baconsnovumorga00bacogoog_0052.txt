BACON'S SCIENTIFIC ATTAINMENTS. 23

The third, that he grossly exaggerated the defects of his own time,
which, in spite of all that be says, was really one of great and
fruitful intellectual activity.

This section (which must necessarily be far briefer than its im·
portance demands, though 1 trust that its omissions will, toa great
extent, be supplied in the notes on the Novum Organum itself) cannot
be more appropriately commenced than by the following sketch of
Bacon’s errors and omissions, beced, it must be remembered, by
the not unfriendly hand of Mr. Spedding ⁴¹:

‘It is impossible, I think, to read Mr. Ellis’s remarks upon those
parts of his works in which he comes in contact with what we call the
exact sciences—mathematica for instance, and mechanica—and not
to feel that in the faculty of dtitrirgur'rlring Mercrius-the faculty
whose office is (as he describes it in the Novum Organum, i. 5 5) figere
contemplatrbnes, et morari et haerere in omni subtilitate dfflrentriamm,
-be was (comparatively at least) deficient This appears both from
the imperfect account of the existing condition of those sciences
which be gives in the De Augmentis Scientiarum, no notice being
there taken of some of the most important advances which had been
made by the writers immediately preceding him; and from his own
experimenta and speculations upon subjects which required their help.
Though he paid great attention to Astronomy, discussed carefully
the methods in which it ought to be studied, constmcted lor the
satisfaction of his own mind an elaborate theory of the heavens, and
listened eagerly for the news from the stars brought by Galileo’s
telescope‚ he appears to have been utterly ignorant of the discoveries
which had just been made by Kepler's calculations⁴'. Though he
complained in 1623 of the want of compendious methods for facili· .

The whole of this Preface is very interesting. Mr. Spedding ascribes Bacon's
mental defecta and his ignoranoe of so many scientific details mainly to the great
predominanoe, iu his mind, of the discursive orer the critical faculty, the faculty
which detects the broader resemblances and more striking analogica of things over
that which notes differenoes and patiently studies particular facts.

‘³ See Mr. Ellis's Preface to the Descriptio Globi Intellectualis. [Vol. iii. pp. 723,
7²⁴· ‘The treatise De Stella Martis was published in 1609. and becme known iu
Englsnd at least as early as 1610. Harriot, it appears from Professor Rigaud's
account of his papers, was theu in correspondeuce with Kepler. and repeated his
calculatione That Bacou was acquaiuted with his writings we can hardly believe ;
they bear so directly on the questions which he has discussed that be could scarcely
have neglected to notice them. had he known them even by report']
