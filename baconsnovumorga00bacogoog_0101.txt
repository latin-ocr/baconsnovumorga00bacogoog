method was often unscientific, his ideas were often vague and indis

preconceived and assumed rather than gathered from experience and
reasoning“.

lt should, however, he recollected that scientific ideas, adequate
and appropriate to the explanation os scientific laets, are usually the
slow growth oi time, and occur to men only as the sequel os many
unsuccesslul efforts. Even had Aristotle's collection oi facts been
more complete and accurate than it was, they had hardly been known
sufficiently long to suggest either to him or others the conceptions
which were adequate to connect and explain them We are not
perhaps justified in expecting the master to have elfected more than

want ol scientific instrumente, but, as Lange remarks, the moderas began their work
ol discovery with almost exactly the same serenare appliances as the ancients, and
invented the instrumenta as they proceeded in their researehes.
