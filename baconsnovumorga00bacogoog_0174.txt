BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE NOVUM ORGANUM. 145

aussi vaniteux, aussi fanfaron, aussi boursouffle que Bacon ς mais
ce qui etablit une difference‚' &e (Preface du Traducteur, p. xxv.)

‘Aprcs de telles preuves, il est donc permis de dire maintenant que le
rdle de Bacon, dans l’histoi're des sciences d’observation, fut a peu
pres celui de Julien l’Apostat dans l'histoire du christianisme‚ et que la
seule place vraiment saillante qu’ll occupera dorenavant dans les
fastes du passe est celle du plus hardi et surtout duplus heureux des
mystificateurs connus; ace titre il brillera, en les eliacant, audessus
du comte de Salat-Germain etde Cagliostro.' (Id. p. xxiii.)

These various accusations against Bacon or his philosophy, when
we state theru in brief, resolve themselves into the following: 1st, he
was an athelst3 and, he was a plagiarist; 3rd, he vas a smatterer ;
4th, his vorks have had no influence in the subsequent progress
of science; 5th, his proposed methods of investigation are defective,
if not false, in statement, and inapplieable in practice. As these
different charges are discussed, and my own opinion on them stated,
in other parts of the Introduction, itis unnecessary that 1 should say
anything further on them in this place.

ᾧ 17. BlBLIOGRAPHY OF THE NOVUM ORGANUM.

Trrovnn the first Edition of the Novum Organum did not appear
till the year 1620, we are informed by Dr. Rawley (in the Life of
Bacon, prefixed to the Resuscitatio) that he had himself seen at least
tvelve revisions of the work, ‘revised year by year, one aster another;
and every year altered and amended in the frame thereof ⁷⁴: If this

promissum, liberavi fidem meam, explicavi pro meo modulo definitiones, petitiones,
communes sententias, et octo priores propositiones Elementorum Euclidis. Hic
annis fessus, cyclos artemque repono.' (Praelectiones &e., Oxonii, 1621.) Dugald
¹Stevrart somevvhere adduces these words ss a proof, if 1 recollect rightly, of the prolix
aad elementary teaching of the lime, and from him probably (or from Malehranche,
who also refers to them as aflording an example of the abuse of the commenta-
torisl spirit, Dela Recherehe de la Ve‘rile, livre ii. amparate, ch. 7), though with
some slight exaggeration, Liebig borrows the story. But his translator, having
never probably heard of Sir Henry Savile, and either being very careless or having
avery imperfect knowledge of the German language, allodes to this anecdote ns
illustrating the character of the lectores given at this time ‘a saville et ὰ Oxford’ l

ἵ* Cp. the Auctoris Vita, prefixed to the Opnscula Varia posthuma, published in
1658: ‘Ipse reperi in archivis Dominationis suae autographa plus minus duodecim
Organi novi, de anno in annum elaborati et ad incudem revocati ; et singulis annis
ulteriore lima subinde politi et castigati.'
