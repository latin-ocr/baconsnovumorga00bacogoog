Syllogismus ad principia scientiarum ¹³ non adhibetur, ad
media axiomata frustra adhibetur ¹⁴, cum sit ¹⁵ subtilitati
naturae longe impar. Assensum itaque constringit, non res.

XIV.

Syllogismus ex propositionibus constat, propositiones ex
verbis, verba notionum tesserae sunt ¹⁶. Itaque si notiones
ipsae (id quod basis rei est) confusae sint, et temere a rebus
abstractae3 nihil in iis, quae superstruuntur, est firmitudinis.
Itaque spes est una In inductione vera ¹⁷.

¹³ The ἀρχαί of Aristotle. That the ἀρχαί, being the ultimate major
premisses from which syllogism proceeds, do not themselves admit of
syllogistic proof‚ is constantly insisted on by Aristotle. See, for instance,
An. Post. l. 2 (72 a. 7), ἀρχὴ δ’ r'orlv ἀποδείξεως πρότασις ciperon, dproos δὲ
ἧς μή ἐστιν villo προτέρα. He also constantly insists on the fact that these
ultimate principles must be gained by induction. See, for instance, Ethics,
vi, 3. (3), Ἐκ προγινωσκομένων δὲ πᾶσα διδασκαλία, ὥσπερ eal ἐν rois ἀναλυτι-
κοῖς λέγομεν· ἦ μὲνγὰρ δι’ ἐπαγωγῆς, ἦ δὲ συλλογισμῷ. Ἣ μὲν δὴ ἐπαγωγὴ
ἇρχὴ e'orr καὶτοῦ καθόλου, d δὲ συλλογισμὸς r’rr τῶν καθόλου. Eiolv ἄρα ἀρχαὶ
ἐξ ὧν ό συλλογισμὸς, bv οὐκ ἔστι συλλογισμός· ἐπαγωγὴ dpu. Amongst other
decisive passages to the same effect may be specially cited An. Post. ii. 19,
and Metaph. i. 1.

¹⁴ For if the principia scientiarum be uncertain, the axiomata media,
which are deduced from them, must, of course, be uncertain as well.
We cannot rely on the trutb of the conclusion, till we bave placed beyond
doubt the truth of the premissos.

¹⁶ The reason here assigned applies to both the preceding clauses.

¹⁸ For the metaphor, cp. Arist. Sopb. El. ch. 1.

The spoken or written word, it is true, is only the symbol of the notion in
the mind of the speaker or writer, but could the notion itself be formed or
retained without the use of language? This or that particular word is, of
course, separable from the corresponding idea (as is shewn by the mere
fact of translation from one language into another), but, without the use
of signs of some kind or other, we could hardly make any progress
in thInking. These consideratione, however, do not affect the trutb of
Bacon's criticism. Whether we speak of the ultimate constituents of the
syllogism as words or notions, it is essential to all reasoning that we
should have a clear understandIng of thern.

¹⁷ Cp. ii. 19, with the notes on that Aphorism. At first sight, it
may not seem plaIn why it should be the office of Inductiou to remedy
the defeet of obscure, false, or inadequate notione. But all notione,
we must recollect, involve judgments. In forming or attempting to
realise a notion, we really assert a number of propositions. Thus,
if I put before my mind the notion of gold, 1 thInk of it as yellow,
