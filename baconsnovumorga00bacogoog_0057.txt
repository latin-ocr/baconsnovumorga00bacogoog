to Bacon, who did not claim more than a general acquaintance with
the special branches of science.

It appears, at first sight, less excusable, whether we put it down to
laclr ol curiosity, or to want of sufficient appreciation oi its import-
ance, that Bacon makes no mention ol Harvey's great discovery of
the Circulation os the Blood. As Harvey began to teach this doctrine
in 1619, and as he was court-physician to James 1, itis difficolt to
suppose that Bacon had heard nothing of it ³⁹. The probability is
that, like most os Harvey’s contemporaries, he regarded the theory as
hardly worthy ol serious discussion. Aubrey tells us he hod heard
Harvey say that ‘aster his booke ol the Circulation os the Blood
came out [in 1628], he fell mightily in his practice, and ’twas be-
lieved by the vulgar that he was crack·brained; and all the physi-
ξ tians were against his opinion, and enwyed him ω]

Though the true theory of the Motion ol Projectiles had not been
distinctly stated till the publication ol Galileo's Dialogues on Motion
in 1638, still the speculations of Tartalea, Digges, dre, ought, ii they
had been known to Bacon, to have saved him frorn shewing such
complete ignorance, when treating ol the subject, as he exhibits in
Nov. Org. ii. 36 (6), ii. 48 ad fin, and other places ⁶¹. lt is curious
that one of the books (the Pantometria, published in 1591), in which
Digges speaks of the compound motion ol a projectile, was dedicated
to Bacon’s father. '

Notwithstanding his frequent criticisms ol the Peripatetic doctrine
os Motion, it is plain that Bacon entertained no doubt ol the ‘latio
gravium versus tertam, et levium versus ambitum coeli ’ζ’ or ol the

Dictionary, Historical and Critical, based on Bayle, by Bemard, Eirch, δια, London,
1735, vol. iii. p. 558. In the note on this and the preceding page are several
extracta irorn Boyle's papers, letters, &o Boyle was certainly quite as much a
belieser in the transmutation ol the metals, and on much the same grounds, as
Bacon. See some carious passages in his Works, vol. ii. pp. 515, 5163 vol. iii. p. 621
(ed. ol 1744). In the former passage. he seems to entertain no kind ol doubt that
he has produced silver out ol gold, ‘or at least a new kind ol metal very different
from gold* He proceeds to conclude generally ‘that there may be areal tratu-
mutation ol one metal into another, even among the persectest and noblest metals,
and that elleced by iactitions agents in a short time, and, il I may so speak, after
a mechanical mannen’

⁵⁹ In the Historia Densi et Rari, and in the very part which was probably written
during Bacon's last 'quinquenniurn,‘ he thinks it a sufficient account ol pulsation in
the heart and arteries of animals, to say that it is dne to the errdless and alternate
dilatation and contractiori ol the spirits. See E. and S., sol. ii. p. 263.
