(3) At tertius ex septem modis refertur ad magnum illud
organum, tam naturae quam artis, quoad operandum 3 videlicet
calidum et frigidum. Atque in hac parte claudicat plane
potentia humana, tanquam ex uno pede. Habemus enim m·
lorem ignis, qui caloribus solis (prout ad nos deferuntur) et
caloribus animalium quasi infinitis partibus potentior estet
intensior. At deest frigus ⁸, nisi quale per tempestates
hyemales, aut per cavernas, aut per circundationes nivis et
glaciei, haberi potest: quod in comparatione aequari potest
cum calore sortasse solis meridiano in regione aliqua ex
torridis, aucto insuper per reverberationes montium et pa-
rietum3 nam hujusmodi utique tam calores quarn frigora
ab animalibus ad tempus exiguum tolerari possunt. Nihili
autem sunt sere prae calore lomacis ardentis, aut alicujus
frigoris quod huic gradui respondeat. Itaque omnia hic apud

ἵ This remark has, no doubt, reference to Baeon's theory ο[ the Trans·
mutability ο[ the Elements. See Aph. 48 i 1 il, with notes. But there is
a certain sense in which his anticipation has been verified. For we now
know that water might be produced, by means ο[ cold and compression
alone, from its constituent gases, hydrogen and oxygen. ln lact, as
already pointed out, all aerilorm fluids are merely liquids kept in the state
ol vapour by heat, and a sufficient amount ο[ cold and pressure will reduce
them into the liquid stnte. See note 37 on Aph. 33.

⁸ Bacon, it need hardly be repeated, regarded coldas a distinet quality
[τοτιι heat, not merely as a lower degree ο[ it. The expression ‘variations
ο[ temperature,' had it existed in his time, might, as 1 have already pointed
out, have preserved him from this error.

The greatest cold known is produced by the evaporation os liquefied
gases. ‘By surrounding the gas under experiment by concentric tubes
containing liquid oxygen, which in tum is surrounded by liquid ethylene,
Olszewski obtained temperatures low enough to solidily nitrogen, carbonic
oxide, marsh gas, and nitric oxide. The evaporation ο[ solid nitrogen
under a pressure ο[ 4111111 produces a temperature ο[ -225⁰ (C.·-· - 373 tt).

⁹ Here again (cp. Aph. 48 (12), (19) ) he alludes to his theory of the
rapidly increasing density ο[ bodies, as we approach the centre ο[ the
eanh.
