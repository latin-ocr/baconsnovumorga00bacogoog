motion of the warch and the wearer oi the watch And it the wearer oi
the watch is sailing on the sea, it may participate in no less than four
‘extraneous and common’ motions, namely the motion ol the wearer, the
motion of the ship‚ the motion ol the sea, and, when the wearer breathes,
the motion ol the watch itsell. This distinction is olten applied by
Aristotle to the motione ol the heavenly bodies. See, lor instance, De
Coelo, ii. 13 (p. 293 a. 1, δια), Phys. viii. 6 (2591). 28, dra). Cp. De
Coelo, ii. 14 (296 b. 27, dic). The Aristotelian terms by which Proper
Motion is expressed are οῖιιεὶο or ἴδιοι φορά.

. ²* This tendency is abundantly exemplified in Aristotle’s physical works. ’
He is so anxious to solve every difficulty which presente itsell to
his mind, that he is seldom content with a bare statement oi facts, without
starting some theory in explanation of them. As a consequence ol this
tendency, the facts are olten very meagre, and the theories very crude.

’θ τὰ ὁμοιομερῆ may denote either aggregates composed oi like parts, or
these ‘like parts' themselves. Anaxagoras maintained that there was an
inlinity ol elements‚ some ol which were homogeneous with others, though
in the original chaos they were all mixed up in inextricable confusion.
Thus, there existed from the first particles ol fiesh‚ bone, dic, which, by
a process of σύγκρισις and διάκρισις, have been disentangled lrom the dis·
orderly mass and lasbioned by νοῦς or the Supreme Intelligence into flesh,
bone, δια, as we now find thern in the κόσμος or orderly universe. Πάντα
χρήματα ἦν ὁμοῦ· εἶτα νοῦς ἐλθὼν uirrd διεκόσμησε. See Metaph. l. 3.

For the various philosophicaltheories mentioned in this paragraph, the
student should reler to the passages collected in Ritter and Preller's His·
toria Philosophiae, as well as to some good History ol Philosophy, such aa
that of Ueberweg or Zeller.

²⁶ These atoms, unlike tbe homoiomera oi Anaxagoras, had no qua·
litative difference. They were supposed to differ only in shape (σχήματι)
as A and N, or arrangement (τάξει) as AN and NA, or position (θέσει) as
Zand N. The κόσμοι resulted from these atoms through ἀνάγκη. See
Metaph. i. 4 The atoms oi Democritus were conceived of as rigid and
unchangeable (non fluxae), as having existed from etemity, and as moving
in vacivo. Bacon combats these various positions in Nov. Org. ii. 8, 48
ad fin, and other parts of his works.

²⁷ Coelum et terra=mlp καὶ γῆ. lt is questionable how sar Parmenides
intended to express physical conceptions by these words, and bow lar he
intended them to be simply symbolic ol the metaphysica] contrast of being
