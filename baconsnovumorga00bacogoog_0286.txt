male institutae, tales sequuntur philosophiae et contempla·

utimur in universo illo processu, qui a sensu et rebus ducit ad

axiomata et conclusiones. Qui quidem processus quadru-

destitutionibus substitutiones, fallaciis rectificationes deben-

abstrahuntur, et interminatae et confusae sunt, quas ter-
minatas et bene finitas esse oportuit. Terti0, inductio mala
est, quae per enumerationem simplicem principia concludit
scientiarum, non adhibitis exclusionibus et solutionibus, sive
separationibus naturae debitis ⁷⁰. Postremo, modus ille in·

method. Their success, on the other hand, in some branches of Mathe·
matics was due to the extent to which this method had been already
elaborated.

Again, it has often been remarked tbat fundamental differences in
opinion generally turn on fundamental differences in method. Thus, the
method of Locke‚ which is mainly inductive, and the method of Desmrtes,
which is mainly a priori, result in two widely different systems of mental
philosophy. The introspective method of Butler and the historioal
method of Hume, again, though both of them essentially inductive, lead
to very divergent theories of ethics. The position, in fact, might be illus·
trated to almost any extent in the history of either ancient or modern
philosophy.

‘³ Bacou points out four respects in which the present methods of
demonstration are defective:

(1) The senses frequently fail or deceive us;

(2) Our notions are confused and ill-defined;

(3) We employ the vicious method of Inductio per Enumerationem
Simplicem;

(4) We fly off at once to the principia maxime generalia, instead of
ascending to them gradually through the axiomata infima and media.

⁸¹ Baton might have added that the substitutions are to be supplied
mainly by instruments, the rectifications mainly by methods.

⁷⁰ In opposition to the ordinary method of Inductio per Enumerationem
Simplicem, Bacon proposes a method of elimination. lt is not, however,
quite clear what is the precise character of the method which be has in
view. We may take his words either in a general sense or with special
reference to the methods described in Book ii. ln the former case, the
passage might be paraphrased as follows: ‘We ought to exclude all
instances which do not throw light on the object of enquiry, resolve complex
