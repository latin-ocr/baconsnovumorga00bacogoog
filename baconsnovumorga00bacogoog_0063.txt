sixteenth century (who, however, also died as early as 1603), Clavius,
who was employed by Gregory XIII to reform the Calendar and
was called the Euclid oi his age, probably Edward Wright, and pos-
sibly, from his silence, even Stevinus. Amongst the latest oi the
Anti-Copemicans were Thomas Lydiat, who died in 1646, and

. Riccioli, who in his Almagestum Novum, published as late as 1651,

enumerated, according to Whewellss, fifty-seven Copernican argu-
ments, and pretended to reiute thern all.

The list oi Anti-Copemicans, respectable though it be, is not, it
must be aclrnowledged, equal in reputation to that oi the Coper-
nicans, but then posterity, it must be recollected, is always kinder
to the winning than to the losIng side. And even oi the Coper·
nicans, as we have seen, some went only hali way, while others,
probably, did not feel very confident oi the conclusions which they
had embraced. More or less oi hesitation as between the two
theories, or rather as between the various theories, was, perhaps,
the commonest state oi mind among those who were qualified to
give any opinion ⁸⁶, and this sometimes appears to have been the
case, even with Bacon himself, though never to the extent, I believe,
oi actually altering the conclusions which he had formed on the
subject in early lise.

As to the tone in which Bacon treats this question, 1 cannot but
think that most readers have been led to conceive an undue pre·
judice against blm by the illconsidered statement oi Home, that ‘he
¹¹ reiected, with the most positive disdain, the system οἱ Copernicusll)
That he consistently rejected the system oi Copemicus throughout
liie, whether as to the annual or as to the diurnal motion, I certainly
believe, as Ι have pointed out in my notes ⁸⁸5 but, ii we except
a passage in his juvenile performance, the Praise oi Knowledge,
where he speaks oi ‘these new carmen who drive the earth about ⁸⁹,'
and another in the Temporis Partus Masculus ⁹⁰, where, as I have so

passages, 1 have combated a statement made by Dr. Whewell (History oi the In·
ductive Sciences, 3rd ed, vol i. Additious. p. 389), that ‘it would seem as ii Bacon
himself had a leaning to believe the diurnal motion oi the earth, when he wrote
this passage!
