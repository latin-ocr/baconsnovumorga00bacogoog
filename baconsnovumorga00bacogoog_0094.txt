REJEC T ION OF ‘FINAL CA USES? 65

3ηά not with the slightest intention of employing banter, when he
compared the enquiry into Final Causes with a virgin consecrated to
God⁸¹. We may, he conceived, legitimately contemplate the ends
and objects os the various parts os nature, their relations to one
another, and the harmony ol the whole, and so rise to some con-
ception, however saint, os the power and wisdom os Him who framed
the Universa. ‘Quod sit Deus, quod rerum habenas tractet, quod
summe potens, quod sapiens et praescius, quod bonus, ¹¹ a * ¹¹*
etiam err operibus ejus demonstrari et evinci potest⁵⁸2 But then this
enquiry must remain consecrated to the service of God. As soon as
it intrudes into the province of Physica, it is attended with no results;
nay rather, as it diverts the mind from the enquiry into the efficient
and material causes, the proper objects of physics, it becomes
positively baneful“.

Apparently inconsistent, however, with this limitation os the
censure on the pursuit of Final Causea are passages such as that
in Nov. Org. i 48, where he seems to condemn them generally,
as being ‘plane ex natura hominis potius quam universi ⁵⁶)

Now, with regard to these passages, 1 may observe, first, that as
the De Augmentis received Bacon’s final supervision aster the pub·
lication os the Novum Organum, and as far the most explicit and
elaborate passage on this subject is to be found in that work, we are
bound, is there is any contradiction, to accept Bacon's later and more
detailed rather than his earlier and more casual utterances ⁵⁸.

⁵³ ⁴ Nam Causarum Finaliurn inquisitio sterilis est, et tanquam virgo Deo conse·
crata nihil parit.' De Augm. ili. 5. 'Nihil parit) as Mr. Ellis observes in his
note on the passage, simply means ‘non parit opera) This sact will be plain to
any one who will consult the context. Bacon is speaking oi the divisions ol the
‘Doctrina Operativa' The enquiry into Efficient and Material Causes produces
Machanics; that into Fornral Causea produces Magic; that into Ftnal Causes
‘nihil parit.'

Dugald Stewart (Elementa, Ed. Hamilton, Works, vol. iii.) says that this epi·
grammatic marim has been, perhaps, ostener quoted, particularly by French
writers, than any other sentence in Bacon's works; these quotations, he adds, have
generally been made without any reference to the context, aud, consequently, with
oonsiderahle misunderstanding oi Bacon's meaning.

³⁴ ‘ At ex his, Causa Finalis tantum abest ut prosit, ut etiam scientias corrumpat,
nisi in hominis actionibus! Nov. Org. il. 2. See also the passage quoted above
from De Augm. iii. 4.

⁸¹ To this remark it might, perhaps, be objected that the passage in the De
Augmeutis is little more than a repetition os what appeared in Bacon’s earlier
work, the Advanoemeut ot' Learning, which was first published in 1605. But we
