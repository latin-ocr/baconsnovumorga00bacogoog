88 INTRODUCTION.

sagacity. Take, for instance, the passage in Eth. vii. 1 (glz Δεῖ δ’,
ὥσπερ c'rri τῶν dibon, τιθέντας τὰ φαινόμενα, καὶ πρῶτον διαπορήσαντας, οὕτω
δεικνύναι μα’λιστιι μὲν πάντα rb ἔνδοξα περὶ ταῦτα rh πάθη, εἶ δὲ μὴ, τδ πλεῖστα
rol κυριώτατα· ἐὰν γὰρ λύηταὶ τι td δυσχερῆ καὶ καταλείπηται τὰ ἔνδοξα,
δεδογμένον aa εἴη ἱκανῶς ⁴. In his treatises generally, but especially
in the Politics and the Historia Animalium, we find extensive collec-
tions of facts; nor, as l have shewn elsewhere ⁵, did he altogether
neglect experiment. That he was impanent, and even jealous, of
the authority of others ⁸, has generally been brought as a charge
against him, and, about the time of the Revival of letters, was
frequently adduced as an argrcmentum ad hominem by those who
were anxious to throw off the bonds of his own authority.

As the worlrs of Aristotle, and specially his logical works, were
constantly being reproduced and commented on during the Middle
Ages, it would be easy, though superfluous, to accumulate from
mediaeval writers passages on the origin of knowledge ln the per-
ceptions of the senses (as being, at least, its condition, if not its
source), and on the relation of induction to deductiori. lt will be
sufficient, as a specimen, to quote the following passages from the
Metalogicus of John of Salishury (lib. iv. capp. 8, 9), written about
1160: ‘Et sic demonstrandi scientiam statuit, ac si sensu corporeo
teneatur, quae ratio indubitata sic esse convincit. Communes enim
conceptiones a singulorum inductione fidem sortiuntur. Impossibile
enim est universalia speculari, non per inductionem ; quoniam, ut
ait, quae ex abstractione dicuntur per inductiones ignota nota fiunt
Inducere autem non habentes sensum, impossibile est. Singularium
enim sensus est ; nec contingit ipsorum accipere scientiam, neque
ex universalibus sine inductione, nec per inductionem sine sensu.
Fit ergo ex sensu memoria; ex memoria multorum saepius iterata,
experimentum ; ab experimentis scientiae aut artis ratio manat.
Porro ab arte, quae usu et exercitatione tinnata est, provenit facultas
exsequendi ea, quae ex arte gerenda sunt. Sic itaque sensus corporis,
qui prima vis aut primum exercitium animae est, omnium artium
praejacit fundamenta; et praeexistentem format cognitionem, quae
primis principiis viam non modo aperit, sed et parit! ‘Planum
autem est hoc diligentius inspicienti per singula Nam cum sensus,

⁰ The case of Reason versus Authority has never been better or more tersely put
than by Aristotle, Eth. Nic. i. 6 (t): ἀμφοῖν γὰρ ὄντοιν φίλοιν, ὅσιον προτιμᾶν τὴν
ἀλήθειαν. Hence the proverb: ‘Amicus Plato ; magis amica veritas?
