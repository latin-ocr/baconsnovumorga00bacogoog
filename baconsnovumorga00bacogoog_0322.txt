⁸³ This is one of Bacon's shrewdest remarks. It is abundantly illustrated
in the history of science both before and since his time. A new discovery
in science is at first decried as contrary or even fatal to laith; then,
atter a time, it is grudgingly admitted, and incorporated into the received
doctrine, till at last no one dreams ol calling it in question. But the
process soon begins afresh with some more recent discovery, so that a
constant warlare is going on between the unwise theologian and the
scientific investigator. And this warlare is wholly unnecessary, and can
have only one issue. For the scientific theory must ultimately stand or
sall on scientific grounds, and, should it be ultimately admitted, the
theologian, whether he acquiesces in the result or not, must, with the rest
of mankind, bow to the decision of competent judges No thoughtt'ul
man, ol course, can avoid comparing the results ol science with his
religious beliels, but the results os seienee, to be worth anything at all,
must be arrived at by a purely independent process, employing only
scientific data and submitting only to scientific tests. Theman oi science
has a right to demand that his investigations shall not be hampered by
theological prepossessions; but the results at which he arrives become
the common property oi all, and it is sor the theologian to co·ordinate
these results with his religious beliess, or, il need be, to adapt his religious
belieis to the new laets or newly established generalisations which are
presented to him.
