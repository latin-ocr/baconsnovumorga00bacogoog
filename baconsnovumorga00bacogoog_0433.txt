404 NOVUM ORGANUM.

tres tabulas comparmtiae primae (quales posuimus) factas et
pensitatas, accingendi se et tentandi opus interpretationis
naturae in affirmativa3 tam ex instantiis tabularum, quam
ex iis quae alias occurrent. Quod genus tentamenti, per-
missionem intellectus, sive interpretantium imhoatam, sive
vindemiatebnem primam appellare consuevimus.

Vindemtatio prima deforma caliii.

Animadvertendum autem est, formam rei inesse (ut ex
’ iis quae dictasunt plane liquet) instantiis universis et singulis,
in quibus res ipsa inest ⁹⁷3 aliter enim forma non esset: itaque
nulla plane dari potest instantia contradictoria. Attamen

ultimate success was doubtless in no slight degree due to his unsuccessful
efforts There is hardly any branch of science in which it might not be
affirmed that, without a number oi false guesses‚ true theories could never
have been a'ttained.' Inductive Logic, 4th Ed, p. 98.

Mr. Ellis (in his General Preface, vol. i. pp. 36, 37) makes the following
important remarks on the relation of this Aphorism to the others of the
Second Book: ‘The phrase Permissio Intellectus sufficiently indicates
that in this process the mind is suffered to follow the course most
natural to it; it is relieved from the restraints'hitherto imposed on it, and
reverts to its usual state. ln this vindemiatio we accordingly find no
reference to the method of exclusion: it rests immediately on the three
tables of comparentis, and though of course it does not contradict the
results of the Exclusiva, yet on the other hand it is not den'ved from them.
lf we lose sight of the real nature of this part of the investigation, which
is merely introduced hythe way “because truth is more easily extricated
hom error than from confusion,” we also lose sight of the scope and
purport of the whole method. All that Bacon proposes henceforth todo
is to perfect the Exclusiva; the vindemiatio prima, though it is the closing
member of the example which Bacon makes use of,· is not to be taken as
the type of the final conclusion of any investigation which he would
recognise as just and legitimate. It is only a parenthesis in the general
method, whereas the Exclusiva, given in the eighteenth aphorism of the
second book, is a type or paradigm of the process on which every true
induction (inductio vera) must in all cases depend.'

⁹² See notes on Aphs.16‚17. The argument would have been perfectly
correct, not only with reference to ‘natures’ but also with reference to
‘causes’ if he bad said that, wherever the supposed form is, there the
thing itself must be. Thus, if we start tbe hypothesis that motion is
causally connected with beat, and we find, as a matter of fact, that motion
is always attended by an increase of temperatura, the hypothesis becomes
an ascertained truth. We can, as l have so frequently stated, argue with
certainty from the cause to the effect, but not from the effect to the muse.
