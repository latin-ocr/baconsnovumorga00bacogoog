PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. xvii

The question as to the morality of Bacon's own
conduct, in the various passages of his life, will pro·
bably continue to divide biographers‚ historiam, and
reviewers to the world's end. His was no doubt, a
complex character, and the events and persons that
constituted his surroundings, rendered, in his case, the
conduct of life peculiarly difficult. But, as regards
both his character and his acts, I believe that the good
largely preponderated over the evil, nor can l, on these

hostile bias. To me it appears of great importance to
the fame and credit of Bacon, as well as to the cause
of historical truth, that even ‘readers of limited leisure'
should not ‘be prepared to accept’ Dr. Abbott's book
‘on its own merits as a fairly complete account of the
life and works of Bacon’ but that they should supple-

and Times of Francis Bacon' (London, Trtibner and
Co, 1878). The latter work, which appeared four
years later than the last volume of the ‘Letters and
Life‚’ not only contains an abridgment, supervised by
Mr. Spedding himself, of his larger work, but, in some
places new matter of importance, and it appears to me

work or to the valuable series of papers contributed

by Mr. Spedding to Vols. XXVII and XXVIII of the
Contemporary Review, under the titles of the ‘Latest

Theory aboup Bacon' and ‘Lord Macaulay's Essay on
