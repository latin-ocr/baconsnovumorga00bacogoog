ANTICIPATIONS OF BACON'S DOCTRINES. 89

secundum Aristotelem, sit naturalis potentia indicativa rerum, aut
omnino non est aut vix est cognitio, deficiente sensu!

Fertile, however, as these principles might have been in a different
age, it must be consessed that they bore little fruit in the time oi
which I am speaking. It was only men of rare curiosity or os a
singular love oi nature, like Albert the Great⁷ or our own Roget
Bacon, who saw the supreme importance oi interrogating facts or ot ¹
basing science upon experience. To the latter oi these great names ι’
l shall devote some little space.

First, however, 1 may remark, by way os parenthesis, that Dr.
Whewell⁸ discovers certain resemblances between the mediaeval
mystic Richard os St. Victor (died 1¹7 3) and Francis Bacon. Oi
these, the most important is the dictum that ‘Physical science
ascends from effects to causes, and descends again from causes to
effects⁹.' This, however, appears to me to be one of those incidental
utterances which might easily be made without perceiving‚ as Bacon
undoubtedly did perceive, its scientific value or the practical con·
sequences to which, if properly developed, it would lead.

The comparison os the speculations oi Roger Bacon (who wrote
towards the end ofthe thirteenth century) with those os his namesake
are specially interesting, and have been made much oi by those who
deny or depreciate the originality of the latter ¹⁰. The whole spirit oi
his works bears, perhaps, a nearer resemblance to those oi Francis
Bacon than can be found in any intermediate writer, but here, oi
course, I must confine myseli to specilic points and to a few typical
quotations.

ln the Opus Majus, Part vi. capp. 1, 2 (Ed. Jebb, pp. 445, tec), there
is a striking disquisition on the necessity and utility os experimental
science The passage is too long to quote at length, but, amongst
other things, he says: ‘Sine experientia nihil sufficienter sciri potest.
Duo enim sunt modi cognoscendi, scilicet per argumentum et experi·'
mentum. Argumentum concludit et iacit nos concludere quaestionem,

² A good account oi the physical speculatione oi this philosopher will be found
in Pouchet, Histoire des Sciences Naturelles au Moyen Age, and oi his relation to
the Scholastic controversie in Haurean, De la Philosophie Scolastique, chs. 17-19.

¹ Philosophy oi Discovery, pp. 52, 53.

⁸ ‘Physica est qnae ceum rernm er suis effectibus, et effectus ex causis depre-
hendit’ Tractatus Exceptionum, lib. 't cap. 7. A little above, he says, ⁴ Physica
tractat de invisibilibus visibilium causis’

¹⁰ See, especially, Pouchet, Histoire des Sciences Naturelles nu Moyen Age ou
Albert Ie Grund et son epoqne, pp. 326-370. 1 refer to Pouchet as less oi a
pertisan than many other writers who have handled the same subject.
