Latens autem Processus³⁷, de quo loquimur, longe alia res
est quarn animis hominum (qualiter nunc obsidentur) facile
possit occurrere. Neque enim intelligimus mensuras quasdam,
aut signa, aut scalas processus in corporibus spectabiles3 sed
plane processum continuatum, qui maxima ex parte sensum
sugit.

Exempli gratia; in omni generatione et transformatione
corporum, inquirendum quid deperdatur et evolet, quid maneat,
quid accedat3 quid dilatetur, quid contrahatur3 quid uniatur,
quid separetur3 quid continuetur, quid abscindatur; quid im-
pellat, quid impediat3 quid dominetur, quid succumbat3 et
alia complura.

Neque hic rursus, haec tantum in generatione aut transfor-
matione corporum quaerenda sunt3 sed et in omnibus aliis
alterationibus et motibus similiter inquirendum quid antece·
dat, quid succedat; quid sit incitatius, quid remissius3 quid
motum praebeat, quid regat3 et huiusmodi. Ista vero omnia

³⁷ See Playsair’s Preliminary Dissertation to the Encyclopaedia Bri-
tannica, Remarlts on the Novum Organum: ‘Latent Process is the secret
and invisible progress by which sensible changes are brought about, and
seems, in Bacon’s acceptation‚ to involve the principle, since called the
law oj'contr'nur'ty, according to which, no change, however small, can be
affected but in time. To know the relation between the time and the
change ell'ected in it, would be to have a perfect knowledge of the latent
process. ln the liring oi a cannon, for example, the succession ol events
during the short interval between the application nithe match and the
expulsion os the ball constitutes a latent process oi a very remarkable
end complicated nature, which, however, we can now trace with some
degree oi accuracy. ln mechanical operations, we can often follow this
process still more completely. When motion is communicated lrom any
body to another, itis distributed through all the pens oi that other,
bya law quite beyond the reach oi sense to perceive directly, but yet
subject to investigation, and determined by a principle which, though
late in being discovered, is now generally recognised. The applications
ol this mechanical principle are perhaps the instances in which a
latent, and, indeed, a very recondite process has been most completely

analysed.'
