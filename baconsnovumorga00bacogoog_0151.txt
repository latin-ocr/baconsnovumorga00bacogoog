122 ’ “ INTRODUCTION.

the interpretation to be put upon his silence with respect to Bacon's
name and works.

Pemberton, ln his View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy (1728),
informs us distinctly that Newton ‘approved oi the following treatise,
a great part of which we read together’ (Presace). Now, in the
Introduction to this work, the author almost at once begins to speak
os the irrational method formerly pursued ln scientific enquiries, by
‘framing conjectureS,’ ‘undertaking intire systems,' ‘iathoming at
once the greatest depths of nature,’ &c ‘Whereas the only method,
that can aliord us any prospect ol success in thIs difficult work, is to
make our enquiries with the utmost cantion, and by very slow
degrees’ ‘This neglect’ he proceeds, ‘ol the proper means to
enlarge our knowledge, JoIned with the presumption to attempt what
was quite out of the power of our limited saculties, the Lord Bacon
judiciously observes to be the great obstruction to the progress ol
science. lndeed that excellent person was the first who expressly
writ against this way ol philosophising; and he has laid open at
large the absurdity of it in his admirable treatise, intitled Novum
Organon Scientiamm; and has there likewise described the true
method, which ought to be followed! He then goes on to give
a copious account ol some portione os the F irst Book os the Novum
‚Organum especially of the ‘Duo viae' (Aph. 19) and the ‘idola'
and continues: ‘But what surprizIng advancements in the know-
ledge of nature may be made by pursuing the true course in philo
sophical enquiries, when those searches are conducted bya genius
equal to so divine a work, will be best understood by considering
Sir Isaac Newton's dIscoveries.’ In attempting to give an account ol
the ‘principles whereon Sir Isaac Newton proceeds’ the author
evidently has Bacon's method constantly in view, and, in expouud·
ing the third ol the ‘Regulae Philosophandi,’ he again mentions him
by name: ‘The only cautIon here required is * * * * * as the Lord
Bacon very judiciously directa' Now, supposing Newton to have
seen this Introduction, as seems very probable, the controversy may
be regarded, l think, as deterrnined, and we may, at least, conclude
that Newton would have been ready to acknowledge his obligations
to the precepts and warnings, contained in the First Book ol the
Novum Organum.

Maclaurin, again, in his Account os Sir Isaac Newton’s Philoso
phical DiscoverIes (published, alter his death, in 1748), evidently
regards the connexion between Bacon and Newton as a very close
one. The whole ol his remarks on Bacon are well worth attention
