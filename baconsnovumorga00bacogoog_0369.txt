advanee in the analyses and rules ol logie in any way corresponding with
the advance which is constantly taking place in the individual sciences?
On the whole, 1 think, it maybe answered that there is. For what is
Logic but the analysis oi the most correct modes oi reasoning in each de-
partment os human thought, and the construction of rules based on such
analysis? Now reasoning is constantiy being applied to new subjects or
to new branches of old subjects; complicated cases of reasoning, too, are
constantly being unravelled and referred to simple principles. Hence,
though we are never likely to discover any new laws oi thought or to add
to the simple formulae to which all reasoning may be reduced in the last
resort, yet we may be constantly gaining a wider knowledge oi the appli-
catione, and possibly ol the necessary modificatione, of our rules, increased
practical skill in weighing arguments and detecting fallacies, and a juster
view oi the special characteristics which distinguish the reasoning and
method oi each particular scienee. And that logie (in the largest sense
oi the term) has, as a matter ol dact, advanced, as the particular arts and
sciences have advanced, though not, perhaps, always in the same propor-
tion‚ hardly adrnits, l conceive, ol any doubt.

The dependence os Logic on the condition os the several sciences is put
in a striking, though undoubtedly an exaggerated, form by Condillac
(Histoire Moderne, livre xre ch.12): ‘Je n'ai pas le courage de vous
parler de ceux qui, avant le renouvellement des sciences‚ ont tente d'en-
seigner l'art de raisonner. Si des Tartares voulaient faire une poetique,
vous pensez bien qu’elle serait mauvaise, parce qu’ils n’ont pas de bons
poetes. ll en est de meme des logiques qui out ete laites avant le dix-
septieme siecle!
