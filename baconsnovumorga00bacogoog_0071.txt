42 INTRODUCTION.

but this circumstance does not detract from the ingenuity oi con·
ception which suggested them.

Humboldt (Kosmos, vol. ii. pp. 322, 379, 380) compliments Bacon
on having in his Historia Ventorum (which Humboldt dates much
too late) considered the direction os the winds in connexion with
temperature and aqueous phenomena, and having thereby laid the
Α foundations oi a theory of the currents oi the atmosphere.

Again, we find, scattered here and there in Bacon’s works, pro-
iound views oi nature, which recent science has done much to
illustrate and confirm. Such is the implied criticism oi the ordinary
doctrine oi species contained in the passage on Realism in Nov. Org.
i. 66. Such, too, is the opinion on the ultimate constitution oi
bodies expressed in his atomic theory ¹⁸, and that on the ultimate
condition oi their parts expressed towards the end oi Nov. Org.
ii. 48 : ‘Etenim in corporibus hic apud nos nulla vera est quies, necin
' integris, nec in partibus ; sed tantum secundum apparentiam! And,
to give one more instance, there is shewn throughout his works a
wonderful appreciation oi the combined unity and variety in Nature,
as wellas oi the necessity of never losing sight of the one in con-
sidering the other. See, sor example, Nov. Org. ii. 17, and the
InstantiaeClandestinae,Monadicae,Deviantes,and Foe 's to which
M. Bouillet so appropriately calls attention (he might havea dthe
Instantiae Conformes and¹ Limitaneae) in his note on that passage.

Bacon’s constant references to the new science oi Magnetism,
recently almost created by Gilbert‚ shewed no unwillingness to
accept novel theories, when they did not, as seemed to him to be
the case with the Copemican theory, involve complex and arbitrary
assumptions.

The suggestions and contributions made by Bacon to the sciences
oi mind and conduct seem to me neither few nor unimportant. But
to these I have drawn attention in two other sections, that on his
general philosophical opinions and that on his influence on Philosophy
and Science.

I have reserved to the last some remarks on the investigation into
the nature oi Heat, which occupies so conspicuous a place in the
Novum Organum. It is quite true, as Mr. Ellis points out in his
General Preiace ¹⁷, that the provisional conclusion adopted by Bacon
in ii. 20, as his vindemiatio Prima, is not the result os the Method os

¹⁶ Amougst many other places, see Nov. Org. ii. 7, 8.
