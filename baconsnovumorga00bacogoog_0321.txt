Quinetiam, ut nunc sunt res, conditio sermonum de natura
sacta est durior et magis curn periculo, propter theologorum
scholasticorum summas et methodos; quicum theologiam
(satis pro potestate) in ordinem redegerint, et in artis sormam
effinxerint, hoc insuper effecerunt, ut pugnax et spinosa
Aristotelis philosophia ⁵⁶ corpori religionis, plus quam par
erat, immisceretur.

Eodem etiam spectant (licet diverso modo) eorum corn-
mentationes, qui veritatem Christianae religionis ex principiis

so interesting in itself, that l cannot reirain from adding it: ‘lf any man
have 3 revelation or a discovery ol which thou knowest nothing but by his
preaching, be not too quick to condemn it; not only lest thou discourage
his labour and stricter enquiries in the search ol truth, but lest thou also
be a {ool upon record ; ior so is every man that hastily judges what he
slowly understands. Is it not a monument ol a lasting reproach, that one
of the popes of Rome condemned the bishop of Salzburg lor saying that
there were antrpodest and is not pope Nicholas deserted by his own party
sor correcting the sermons ol Berengarius, 3ηά making him recant into
a worse error? and posterity will certainly make themselves very merry
with the wise sentences made lately at Rome against Galileo and the
Jansenists. To condemn one truth is more shamelul than to broach two
errors: sor he that in an honest 3ηά diligent enquiry misses something
ol the mark, will have the apologies os human infirmity, and the praise ol
doing his best; but he that condemns a truth when it is told him, is
an envious fool, and is a murderer of his brother's same, and his brother's
reason!

Mr. Mill discusses the incapacity of conceiving the existence olAntipodes
in two places ot' his Logic, namely, bk. ii. ch. 5. § 6, and bk. v. ch. 3.
§3. It is, perhaps, superfluous to remark, with reference to these
passages, that Mr. Mill's views as to the relation oi inconceivability to
impossibility are combated by Mr. Herbert Spencer.

⁵⁸ In the corresponding passage of the Cogitata et Visa (E. and S.‚
p. 596), he says: ‘hoc insuper ausi sunt, ut contentiosam et tumultu·
ariam Aristotelis philosophiam corpori religionis inseruerint?

lt has osten been remarked that the distinguishing characteristic oi the
scholastic theology was the union of theological matter with a dialectical
form, the theological matter being derived from the Scriptures and the
F athers, and the dialectical form from the Logic os Aristotle. But with
the form, no inconsiderable portion of the matter oi the Aristotelian
philosophy, especially in the domains of psychology and metaphysics,
frequently effected an entrance, and thus, to a certain extent, determined
both the terminology and the doctrines oi the Mediaeval Church. ln
illustration ol this statement, see Bishop Hampden's Bampton Lectures,
a work which well deserves the attention both os the theologica] and
os the philosophical student.
