larum instantiarum, natura talis, quae curn natura data perpetuo
adsit, absit⁷¹, atque crescat, et decrescat; sitque (ut superius
dictum est) limitatio naturae magis communis⁷². Hoc si mens
jam ab initio lacere tentet affirmative ⁷³ (quod sibi permissa
semper lacere solet), occurrent phantasmata et opinabilia et
notionalia male terminata et axiomata quotidie emendanda;
nisi libeat (scholarum more) pugnare pro salsis⁷⁴. Ea tamen
proculdubio erunt meliora aut praviora pro facultate et robore
intellectus qui operatur. At omnino Deo (formarum inditori
et opifici) aut sortasse angelis et intelligentiis competit formas
per affirmationem immediate nosse, atque ab initio contem·
piationis. Sed certe supra bominem est3 cui tantum con·
ceditur, procedere primo per negativas, et postremo loco
desinere in affirmativas, post omnimodam exclusionem.

Itaque naturae facienda est prorsus solutio et separati03
non per ignem certe, sed per mentem, tanquam ignem divi-
num. Est itaque inductionis verae opus primum (quatenus
ad inveniendas formas) relictio sive exclusiva naturarum

⁷¹ li both these conditions were satisfied, the case would fall under the
Double Method ot' Agreement, or Joint Method os Agreement and Dis·
serence, as it is variously called. lt would not then be subject to the
characteristic imperiection oi the Method oi Agreement, arising lrom
Plurality os Causes, as would happen is we were simply able to establish
the concomitance of the nature in question (‘ natura talis ¹) and the ‘natura
data? See notes on Aph. 4 and note 30 on beginning ol Aph. 13.
hloreover, ii both conditione were satislied, it would be proved that the
ascertained cause was not only a cause but the only cause oi the given
phenomenon.

On the Double Method oi Agreement, and its relation to the question
os Plurality os Causes, the student may refer to the Editor's Inductive
Logic, ch. 3.

⁷² See Aph. 4 The ‘sonu’ is here regarded as=differentia that which
added to the genus, or common nature, gives its distinctive character to
the nature in question. Bacon illustrates his meaning in Aph 20, where
several ‘differentiae’ are proposed as limiting ‘motus,' which is described
as ‘instar generis ad calorem.¹

rr Alluding to the scholastic disputations‚ in which both sides oi a

question were defended, however salse or heretical one oi them might
be regarded as being.
