considerations in opposition to, or extenuation 01, the
severe censures passed by Dr. Abbott. ln the first
place, if 1 mistake not, even within the sphere of
‘practical morality,’ the passages which dictate 3
generous and open line 01 conduct are largely pre·
ponderant over those which suggest, or seem to sug-
gest, a sels-secking, mean, or crooked policy Over
against the Essay ‘Os Simulation and Dissimulation,'
101 instance, we ought, in all saimess, to place the
Essays ‘Of Truth,' and ‘Os Wisdom 101 3 Μ311ἐ Selt'
Then‚ as to those passages which betray the less
generous side of Bacon's practical teaching, there are
two considerations which the modern reader is very apt
to ignore, but which it is most pertinent to the matter
in issue that he should bear in mind. First, these
passages mostly bear on the conduct of lise in politics
and diplomacy, departments 01 activity in which
candour, truthsulness, and sair dealing are not even
now so general as to give us much occasion 101 triumph
over our ancestors Even in this department os
practical morals, there is no doubt that the growth
01 public sentiment has brought about a certain im-
provement, but, aster all, it may be questioned whether
the great difference, in this respect, between Bacon's
time and our own, is not that men then openly avowed
the motives and devices which they now at least pay
the homage to virtue 01 concealing from others and
osten, perhaps, even from themselves. That open deal·
ing as between rival statesmen and rival nations was
a counsel 01 perlection‚ which, however desirable, was
not altogether attainable, might well be taken 101
