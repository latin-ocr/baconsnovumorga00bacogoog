the principles upon which the solution dependedfl. In reviewing
the progress of Mechanics, he makes no mention either of Archimedes
himself, or of Stevinus, Galileo, Guldinus, or Ghetaldus‘l. He makes ,
no allusion to the theory of Equilibrium ⁴⁹. He observes that a ball ¹
of one pound weight will fall nearly as fast through the airas a ball
of two, without alluding to the theory of the acceleration of falling
bodies, which had been made known by Galileo more than thirty
years beforev. He proposes an enquiry with regard to the lever,—
namely, whether in a balance with arms of different length but equal
weight the distance from the fulcrum has any effect upon the in-
clination—though the theory of the lever was as well understood in
his own time as it is nowfl. In making an experiment of his own
to ascertain the cause of the motion ofa windmill, he overlooks an
obvious circumstance which makes the experiment inconclusive, and
an equally obvious variation of the same experiment which would
have shewn him that his theory was false ⁸¹. He speaks of the poles
of the earth as lixed, in a manner which seems to imply that he was
not acquainted with the precession of the equinoxes ⁶³3 and in another
place of the north pole being above, and the south pole below, asa

read it]
