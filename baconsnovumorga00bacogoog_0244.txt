sensum humanum 4⁹ esse mensuram rerum; quin contra,
omnes perceptiones, tam sensus quarn mentis, sunt ex
analogia hominis, non ex analogia universi ⁵⁰. Estque in-

to detect not only the individual peculiarities os our own minds but also
the general tendencies to error which are common to mankind at large.
The mind, though it is beset with phantoms, has not entirely lost the
power os distinguishing between phantoms and realities.

⁴⁹ If this assertion is meant to represent the dictum of Protagoras, it does
so most inadequately. Protagoras asserted, not that the censes uncontrolled
by reason, but that man, meaning the human iaculties generally, was the
measure of all things. Πάντων χρημάτων μέτρον ἅνθρωπος, τῶν μὲν ὄντων ὣς
ἔστι, τῶν δι’ οὐκ ὄντων ὡς οὐκ ἔστιν. Making due allowance ior the relativity
oi human knowledge, that is, understanding the maxim in the form,
‘Man isto man the measure os all things,' it seems to be not only true but
a truism. And the same remark may be made oi the individual form which
the maxim sometimes takes: ‘Every man is to himself the measure oi all
things! In the Theaetetus, however, where the Protagorean dictum is
discussed, the theory that Cognitionis simply sensible Perception is dis-
cussed also, the two enquiries being conlounded‚ and treated as identical.
That Protagoras never expressly asserted the latter proposition is almost
certain. ‘ lt is not improbable,’ says Mr. Grote, ‘that the three doctrines'
(namely, that man is the measure ol all things, that Cognition is sensible
Perception, and that Nature consists ina perpetual motion, change, or
flux), ‘here put together by Plato and subjected to a common scrutiny,
may have been sometimes held by the same philosophers. Nevertheless,
the language os Plato himself shews us that Protagoras never expressly
affirmed knowledge to be sensible Perception: and that the substantial
identity between this doctrine and the different doctrine maintained by
Protagoras, is to be regarded as a construction put upon the two by Plato!
The student has already, in a previous note, been referred to Mr. Grote's
admirable criticism oi the Theaetetus, where the Protagorean dictum, in
its various relations, is discussed at great length and with much acuteness.

That the senses alone are competent to turnish knowledge, without any
subsequent operation oi the intellect upon the materials supplied by them,
seems too crude a theory to have ever been seriously entertained except in
the infancy oi speculation. lt is an entirely different position to assert that
the perceptione nithe senses are an essential condition of knowledge, as is
done by Locke, by Kant, and, in fact, by Aristode, and as appears to
be implied throughout by Bacon himself.

⁵⁰ The word Analogy is used here, as in Aph. 34, in its more general
sense ol ‘relation' and not in either its earlier or later technical sense,
as employed in Logic. For these senses, the student may refer to the
Editor's works on Deductive Logic, pt. iii. ch. i. n. 2, and on Inductive
Logic, ch. 4.

lt is the central thought ol the Baconian philosophy that we must lay
Ι ourselves, as it were, alongside ol nature, and study the facts ol the
