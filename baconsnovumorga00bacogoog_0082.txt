BACON’S RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 53

the latter period oi his liie, have ielt some hesitation as to the
truth or exactitude oi some oi the dogmatic inierences which had
been deduced from its language.

This sharp separation ol Religion and Science, Faith and Reason, ,
probably exercised a considerable influence on the tum which these
speculations took amongst Bacon's successors. Hobbes, while he
shewed no disposition to restrict scientific discussions, relegated reli·
gion altogether to the cognisance oi the magistrate. It was the duty oi
the state to provide a religion ior its subjects, and these had nothing
to do but to accept it without doubt, or, at least, without any expres·
sion os doubt. Thus, the sphere of religion was removed altogether
lrom the arena oi discussion, and we seem here to have almost a
parody ol some oi the principles propounded by Bacon. Pascal,
though whether he was influenced by the writings os Bacon or not
I have no sufficient grounds ior determining, attempted to make the
divorce between Faith and Reason complete, in the interests of
Religion, as, ata later period, Hume did, or pretended to do, in the
interests oi Philosophy. Loclre, though he took agreat interest in
theological questions and himself wrote theological works, shews no
disposition either, on the one hand, to question the authority, or even
the infallibility‚ oi the Scriptores, or, on the other hand, to allow
them to exert any influence on his philosophical speculations. Bayle
tries to exaggerate the discrepancies, but, not having the robust

saith oi Bacon or Ioclre, he seems, with some hesitation, ready to
sacrifice the claims oi religious belief to the exigencies oi human

reason. But, however it may have been with particular individuals,
I cannot question that the general tendency‚ predominant, especially
in England, till quite recently, to draw a distinct line of demarcation
between the spheres oi religion, on the one side, and philosophy and
sciense, on the other, and to combine a sincere belief in the tradi-
tional teaching oi the Bible or the Church with a perfect independ-
ence in the sphere oi speculation, is due, in large measure, to the
reaching and example oi Bacon. Whether this procedure be or be
not legitimare, this is not the place to enquire³³.

tion oi his worlr which Keno Fischer devores to the same subject. But my conclu·
sions, many oi which agree with his, had almost all been previously arrived at by
an independent study ol Bacon's writiugs.
