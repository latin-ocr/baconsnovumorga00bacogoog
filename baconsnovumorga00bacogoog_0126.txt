ingenia perturbantur fatiganturquq’ he asks: ‘Quid ego huic tam
perturbatae reipublicae literariae aliquid ulterius adjungerem, aut
juratis in aliorum sententias, aut absurdissimis bonarum artium cor-

exponerem? Sed vobis tantum iere philosophantibus viris ingenuis,
qui non ex libris solum, sed ex rebus ipsis scientiam quaeritis,
fundamenta ista magnetica commendavi, novo philosophandi genere.
At si ipsis opinionibus et paradoxis assentire aliquibus visum non
suerit, videant tamen experimentorum et inventorum, quibus praecipue
floret philosophia omnis, magnam frequentiamz quae multis nostris

It is needless to add that the body oi Gilbert’s work furnisbes many
examples ol bold, ingenious, and apposite experiments.

When we pass in review these and similar writers, we see that the
origin oi knowledge in the perceptions oi the senses, as taught by Aris
totle, had been a tradition os the schools, which had been constantly
repeated with more or less os emphasis and more or less conscious· ·

predecessors and contemporaries, had become almostacommon-place

ment, too, though more rarely, had been warmly recommended in
theory and successfully adopted in practice. The argument from
