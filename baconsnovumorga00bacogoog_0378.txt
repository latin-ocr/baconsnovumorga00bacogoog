LIB. ΙΙ. 4. 349

tias praecepti excludetur, nec fructum capiet. Terti0, optabit
aliquid sibi monstrari, quod non sit aeque difficile ac illa ipsa
operatio de qua inquiritur, sed propius accedat ad praxin.
Itaque de praecepto vero et perfecto operandi, pronuntiatum

formae verae. Etenim forma naturae alicujus talis est ubl

²⁸ ‘Auxiliary’

¹⁴ So far as ‘Forma’ here = cause, ‘infallibiliter’ must be taken with
the qualification‚ ‘unless there are counteracting circumstances!

²⁸ So far as ‘Fonna' -- cause, and ‘natura illa’ = effect, Bacon is open
to the charge, made against him by Mill, of having neglected to take into
consideration the fact of plurality of causes. The same cause (unless
there are counteracting circumstances) always produces the same effect,
but the sante effect may be due to different causes, as, for instance, death
to disease, poison, or a ahot-wound. See Mill's Logic, ble iii. ch. 103 bk.
v. ch. 3. § 7. See also my Inductive logie, 4th ed, pp. 6, 12 5-t 31, where
l have attempted to restete this doctrine with greater precision.

²⁸ See last note. The effect, in any particular instance, might be due
toa different cause, and would, therefore, not disappear.

²¹ ‘Therefore, the form is always absent, when the given nature is
absent’ (this statement is true), ‘and its absence always involves the
absence of the given nature (this is inaccurate; see above), ‘and it is to
be found in tlte given nature only’ (this is true). My criticism, contained
in the above parentheses, applies, of course, only to the case in which
Form=causa

²⁸ Here ‘form' seems to be taken in the sense of ‘ vera differentia’ (see
Apin 1). The ‘fons essentiae’ spoken of below is regarded as the genus,
and the ‘natura data’ as the species or tota essentia. The last is sup·
posed to be deduced from the fons essentiae by means of (or by the
addition of) the form.

This passage is interesting, because it illustratas both the ambiguity of
the word ‘ Form,’ and the close approximation or even ultimate identity
of its two meanings, as noticed in the Introduction, ὁ 8. Tm ‘F ons
Essentiae' may be regarded as the original substance capable of differen-
tiation, the ⁴ natura data' as the new substance produced from it, and
the ‘form' either as the law governing the development of the one from
the other or as the sum of the attributes which, added to the original
