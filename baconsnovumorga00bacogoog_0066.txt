but we are also given to assume that the almost superstitious rever-
enee with which we now invest the great names of the past ought to
have exercised an equal influence over their contemporaries ⁰⁸.

Having dwelt so long on the unfavourable side of the picture,
we may now turn to the more agreeable task of considering the
positive claims of Bacon to recognition in the History of Scienc'e.
And, first, Ι must warh my readers against expecting too much.
Bacon, I have acknowledged, was a Dilettante (or, to speak more
correctly‚ an Amateur) in science, and, therefore, can hardly be
expected to bc a great discoverer. Nor did he lay claim to any such
distinction. His business was, so Pfflksskmllsth. the philosophy and q

logmdorfscdiefflqmufflnbebndmmfflffl5 what he
hope to 0, was not so much to advance seleuce in his own person,

as to shew others how it might be advanced, and to impel them to
the work. That he was successful in this mission,1 think I have
succeeded in shewing elsewhere ⁰⁹. But, if an Amateur, he was an
Amateur of no ordinary kind The wealth of illustration exhibited
in the Novum Organum and the vast range of subjects reviewed in
the De Augmentis shew a width of knowledge and an universality of
interest which, notwithstanding all the defects we have just been
enumerating, were probably equalled in the case of no other man ’
then living. What he gained in width, he, of course, to a certain
extent, lost in depth 3 for this is the universal law of the human
intellect He was not a Specialist, and, therefore, cannot be said to
have left a great name in the annals of any particular branch of
science. But, to say nothing of the place which he merits in the
history of Science considered in its totality, he did, I conceive,
throw out many suggestions of rare sagacity even in the particular
sciences, and, in a certain sense, anticipate more recent discoveries.
To some of his more remarkable anticipations of subsequent views or
discoveries I shall now proceed to direct the attention of the reader.

⁰⁸ lt has beeu frequently remarked that Bmou never mentions Kepler. It is pro-
hable, us Mr. Ellis remarks, that he was not acquaiuted with Kepler's writlngs, but
the mere omission of his name would findat least a parallel in the case of Descurtes,
who, though long posterior to Bacon, and having frequent occasion to treat of
asuonomical questions, makes no reference to Kepler in any part of his works.

l may heic take the opportunity of mentioning that the best account and criti·
cisun of Bacon’a astronomical views iu detail is to be found in hfr. Ellis's Preface to
the Descriptio Globi Intellectualis, vol. iii. pp. 7¹5—726.
