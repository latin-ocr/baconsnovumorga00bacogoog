cum Paracelso delirare juvet, qui (distillationibus suis scilicet
occaecatus) nutritionem per separationem tantum fieri voluit;
quodque in pane vel cibo lateat oculus, nasus, cerebrum,
jecur2⁷; in succo terrae radix, lolium, ilos. Etenim sicut
saber ex rudi massa lapidis vel ligni, per separationem et
rejectionem superflui, educit solium, florem, oculum, nasum,
manum, pedem, et similia; ita Archaeum illum Fabrum²⁸
internum ex alimento per separationem et rejectionem edu-
cere singula membra et partes asserit ille Verum, missis

¹⁷ 1 borrow, with slight additions, the following note irum Mr. Ellis:
⁴1 have not been able to find any passage in Paracelsus which altogether
corresponds to this remark; and in his Modus Pharmacandi the process
of digestion is described without relerence to the Archeus; nor is it said
that each member “latet in pane vel cibo.” “ Hoc scimus, quod cujusque
membri nutrimentum latitet in pane, carne, et in aliis similiter.” “Quot
vero modis et quibus, necnon qua ratione membris corporis nutrimentum
dividatur, uos ignoramus ς hoe tantum scimus, rem ita se habere ut dixi-
mus.’'-De Mod Pharm. [Operum medico-chimicorum sive paradoxorum
tomi undecim genuini, tom] v. p. 233. (1 use the edition of 1603.)

‘Bacon has, however, correctly stated the general doctrine that alimen·
ration is by separation3 and again Paracelsus affirms that “officium vero
Archei estin microcosmo purum ab impuro separare ’' [rather sequestrare}
—De Morbis Tartareis, [tom] iii. 195. The truth is that Paracelsus's views
are so olten repeated and varied in the course os his writings, that it
is difficult to know how lar his opinions are represented by any particular
passage.

‘lt is well to. remark that, to a certain extent, the theory here so de·
cidedly condemned has, by the recent progress ol organic chemistry, been
shown to be true. Nothing seems better established than that the nitro
genised components of animal bodies are derived lrom the corresponding
elements os their food. With respect to iat, itis, 1 believe, a prevailing
. opinion at present, that animals have the power of converting into it the
starch or sugar ol their food [see Miller’s Organie Chemistry, Elements ol
Chemistry, ath Ed, vol. iii. ξ 1718]; and the productiori ol butyric aeid
by fermentation bas been regarded as at least an illustration of the
transformation. One of the highest authorities on such a subject, however,
1 mean M. Boussingault, was, at least a lew years ago, of a different opinion.
He regarded animal lat as the representative ol the fattymatters contained
in the food!

²⁸ Paracelsus is very fond ol this analogy. Thus, in the De Morbis
Tartareis, cap. 3, he says: ‘Ac insuper Archaeum loco et vice fabri praesto
esse debeat! Hallam (History of Literature, part. i. ch. 7. §§ 17-20) gives
a short account oi the whirnsical theories ol Paracelsus. For a longer
account, see Sprengel, Geschichte der Araneylrunde, Th. iii. Kap. 10.
