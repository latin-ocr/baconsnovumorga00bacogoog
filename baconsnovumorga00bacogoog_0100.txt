CAUSES OF ARISTOTLE’S FAILURE IN PHrSICS. '71

ception 01 scientific induction ⁸⁶, yet the form of induction which he
usually employs is that 01 Simple Enumeration. And, as the enume-
ration 01 instances must, in most cases, necessarily be scanty, he
naturally lapsed into the habit 01 generalising on insufficient data.
The selectrim of instances as distinct 110111 their enumeration (the point
on which Bacon 50 constantly and emphatically insists) would, doubt-
less, have done much to transform the philosophy 01 the time, and to
accelerate the progress 01 science. But it is precisely this difference
which distinguishes modern from ancient induction. As Ι 11ον0 else·
where (see Inductive Logic, 4th Ed, pp. 277, 810.) spoken at some
length on this defect in Aristotle’s nrethod, Ι shall not dwell on it in
this place. It may be described, from different points 01 view, either
aa hasty generalisation, oras the use 01 Inductio per Enumerationem
Simplicem in place 01 Scientifrc Induction.

(5) Another most important cause 01 1011010 15 10 be found in
Aristotle's vague use of general terms. Words like motion, hot and
cold, moist and dry, heavy and light, generation and corruption,
natural and unnatural, &c., are employed simply in their popular
acceptation, without any attempt to give thern a definite ‚and precise
meaning. The problems proposed 101 50101100 being thus wanting
in precision‚ itis not surprising that the results arrived at are vague
and unscientifrc. Under this head, cp. Herschel on the Study of
Natural Philosophy, Part ii. ch 3, and Whewell’s History 01 1110
Inductive Sciences, Book i. ch. 2. sect. 2.

(6) Lastly, 1 may add that Aristotle was 011011 diverted from the study
of 10015, and prevented 110111 perceiving the due significance of those
which he did observe, by his eagerness to discover illustrations of his
favourite metaphysical distinctions, such as δύναμις 01111 ἐνέργεια, 1110 1011
categories with their subdivisions, the 1001 causes, the different kinds
01 motion, and the like. His partiality 101 assigning the final rather
than the efficient causes of phenomena is specially to be noticed
under this head, as having often led him to the perversiori 01 10015 01
10 0110110005 generalisations. This apn'orr' mode 01 investigation, the
disposition to look out 101 111050011005 01 preconceived maxims or
ideas instead 01 patiently considering what conclusions the facts lead
to, is peculiarly opposed to the Baconian method and the spirit 01
1110110111 science.

Briefly to sum up, Aristotle's collection 01 10015 was 011011 inade-

⁸⁵ 011 Aristotle's 1011001100, see some further remarks, with references, at the
beginning of the Section on ‘ Anticipations of Bacon's Method and Teaching.'
