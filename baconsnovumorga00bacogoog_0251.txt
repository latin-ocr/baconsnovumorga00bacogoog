Intellectus humanus illis, quae slmul et subito mentem
ferire et subire possunt, ‘maxime movetur3 aquibus phan-
tasia impleri et inflari consuevit: reliqua vero modo quodam,
licet imperceptibili, ita se habere fingit et supponit, quomodo
se habent pauca illa quibus mens obsidetur 68; ad illum vero
transcursum ad instantias remotas et heterogeneas ⁰⁹, per quas
axiomata tanquam igne probantur, tardus omnino intellectus
est, et inhabilis, nisi hoc illi per duras leges et violentum
imperium imponatur.

Gliscit intellectus humanus, neque consistere aut acquies-
cere potis est, sed ulterius petit, at frustra ⁷⁰. Itaque incogi-

valuable, in calling attention to a counteracting cause. This, for example,
was the case with the deflexions of the planet Uranus, which, being
inexplicable by known causes, directed the attention of astronomers to
the existence of a hitherto undiscovered planet, the planet now called
Neptune. An example, on the other hand, of a theory which was upset
by a single negative instance, is the old doctrine that bodies fall to the
ground ln times inversely proportioned to their weights; the experiments
of Galileo from the leaning tower of Pisa once and for ever put an end
to this delusion.

Bacon may possibly, however, be referring to the method of Exclusions,
of which we shall hear so much in the Second Book. On this method, see
Introduction, ξ 9.

⁶⁸ The mind is unduly influenced by sudden and simultaneous impres-
sions. A familiar example of this tendency is the unreasoning alarm often
produced by railway accidents, accidents in mines, collieries, etc. Such
accidents, especiallyif two or more occur about the same time, ‘fill the
imagination' and excite an alarm out of all proportion to the actual risk
incurred.

⁶⁹ Thus, the phenonrena of electricity are exhibited on a grand scale in ·

thunder and lightning, which ‘strilre the mind suddenly and simultaneously,'
but the study of these instances alone would never have led to the
discovery of those sIngular and subtle laws of electricity which have been
gathered from the ‘remote and heterogeneous instances’ that could have
occurred only to the patient student of nature.

⁷⁰ The restless ambition of the intellectis one of the Impediments to
the attainment of truth. The mInd ever desires to penetrate further
and further into the nature and causes of things; but in vain. And hence,
feeling its helplessness, it falls back upon itself, and supposes the processes
of nature to be carried on with the same ends and in the same manner as
the works of man.

The first sentence of this Aphorism might almost be adopted as the
