Then, as M. Bouillet remarks, many of the fragments and smallcr
picces, such as the Sententiae Duodecim, the Temporis Partus
Masculus, the Inquisitio de Motu, dac, are written in Latin, and
it is hardly likely that Bacon would have thought it worth while to
have these imperfect essays translated for him.

Again, 1 may mention that the MS. of the Cogitata et Visa,
which 1 have personally inspected, is corrected throughout in Bacon's
own hand-writing, and in such a manner as to shew that he was
perfectly familiar with the proprieties of Latin composition ¹⁸. More
over, in the Commentarius Solutus, or Bacon's Common-Place Book,
now in the British Museum (Add. MS. 27,278), the entries are made
almost indifferently in English and latin.

Iastly, the latin of, at least, the First Book of the Novum
Organum, rugged and unclassical as it often is ¹⁸, seems to me so
distinctly to bear the mark of genius, and of the same kind of
genius that we find stamped on Bacon‘s English expression, that
1 should feel it very difficult to refer it to any of the men who sur-
tounded Bacon rather than to Bacon himself.

§5 Bacon’s GENERAL PHILOSOPHICAL OPINIONS.

Bacon was not the founder of a philosophica} school. Indeed,
there is no character which he would himself have more emphatically
repudiated. ‘Primo itaque postulandum videtur, ne existiment ho
mines, noS, more antiquorum Graecorum, aut quorundam novorum
hominum, sectam aliquam in philosophia condere velle²⁰.' But,
though not the founder of any special school of philosophy, it seems
to me unquestionable that his exposition of his method, and, perhaps,
also individual expressions in his writings, contributed in no small
degree to the creation of what is commonly called the empirical

¹⁸ lt may be noticed that in Bacon's letter to Andrewes (Spedding's Letters and
Life, vol. iv. p. 141l, he aske his correspondent ‘to mark nnto me whatsoever shall
seem unio yon either not current in the style,’ &o This is hardly the lenguage of
a man who was not himself responsible for the style. Cp. the Postscript to Bodley’s
Letter to Bacon publishcd in ‘Remnins,' pp. 85-87.

¹⁹ That Bacon had formed for himself an ideal of Latin composition. for the pur·
poses for which he required it, and sn ideal just such as we find exemplificd in the
Novum Organum, is plain from the account given by Tenison (Baconiana. p. 26)
of his discontent with Dr. Playfer's performance: ‘Upon this great occasion he'
(Dr. Playfer) ‘would be over-accurate ; and he sent a Specimen of such superfine
latinity that the iord Bacon did not encourage him to labour further in that work,
in the penning of which he desired not so much neat and polite. as clear, masculine,
aad apt expression! ω Nov.01g.1. 116.
