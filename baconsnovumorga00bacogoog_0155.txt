may in any particular case have been operative. I arn rather inclined
to suppose that the authors of that time, writing sor a learned class,
osten did not think it necessary to mention books or discoveries which
were familiar to their readers, while we, writing lor a more general
public, should be liable to be accused of ignorance or plagiarism, il
we were to observe a similar silence.

Lastly, Newton's tastes and genius lay rather in the way of mathe-
matical science than of experimental philosophy, properly so called.
Bacon’s weakness, on the other hand, consisted in his deliciency oi
mathematical knowledge, and his consequent incapacity of properly
estimating or criticising those branches of science which were already
expressed, or already admitted os being expressed, in a mathematical
form. Hence, we cannot be surprised if the names of Copemicus,
Galileo, and Kepler had ior Newton a greater attraction than that
os Bacon; though it by no means follows that he regarded him
otherwise than with respect and admiration, or that he would not
have been ready sully to express his obligations to him sor having
insisted on raising the superstructure of natural, arrd therefore ulti-
mately os all science, on the true foundations os observation,
experiment, and induction

Having now, as I conceive, succeeded in establishing the fact of
Bacon’s influence on the progress of science,1 have ¹next to ask what
the nature oi that influence was. The title of founder or father of
experimental philosophy, ascribed to him by Maclaurin and others,
expresses the nature of his influence in a rough‚ and, perhaps, a
somewhat exaggerated as well as a somewhat inadequate form, but
one which, I think, is, in the main, true. Instead, however, of
criticising this or similar expressions, it is better that I should state
precisely the conclusions on this subject at which I have myseli
arrived.

rst, He called men, as with the voice of a herald ⁴⁹, to lay thern-
selves alongside ol nature, to study her ways, and imitate her processes.
To use his own homely simile, he rang the bell which called the other
wits together ⁶⁰. Other men indeed had said much the same thing in
whispers or in learned books written sora circle of select readers3
¹but Bacon cried it from the housetops, and invited all men to come

⁴⁰ Thus. he says oi himself (De Angm. iv.1 ad init.): ‘Ego euim buccinator
amb& only taken upon me to ring ι bell to call other wite together? letter
