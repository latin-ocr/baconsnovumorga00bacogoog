144 INTRODUCTION.

tions were carried on for the sake of reward ; the ‘Historia Vitae
et Mortis' was written with the view of augmenting his influence over
the King‚ and was ‘intended to justify the inclination of certain
persons about the court for the pleasures of the table, as well as
other appetitos, and to diminish their fear of death! Notwithstanding
311 these aspersions, we are told at the end of the article that ‘we
must not forget that Bacon, above all others, saw and comprehended
the value and the importance of natural science for the purposes
of life,’ while ‘Bacon's Essays are unexceptionable documents testi-
fying of his genius and sagacity, as well as of his profound knowledge
and correct appreciation of human relations and the different con·
ditioris of men Ψ

Both Liebig and Lasson lay considerable stress on the crude
character of many of the observations and experiments recorded in
the Sylva Sylvarum. It is only fair, therefore. to Bacon's memory to
quote what is said by Rawley in his introduction to that work ⁷⁹.
‘I have heard his lordship often say that, if he should have served the
glory of his own name, he had been better not to have published this
Natural History3 for it may seem an indigested heap of particulars,
and cannot have that lustre which books cast into methods have ;
but that he resolved to prefer the good of men, and that which might
best secure it, before anything that might have relation to himself?
‘And 1 have heard his lordship speak complainingly, that his lord-
ship (who thinketh he deserveth to be an architeet in this building)
should be forced to be a workman and a labourer‚ 3ηά to dig the clay
and burn the brick ; and more than that (according to the hard
condition of the Israelites at the latter end), to gather the straw and
stubble over all the fields to bum the bricks withal’ Nor is the Sylva
Sylvarum so contemptible as Bacon’s adversaries represent it to be.
It is probably far the best and most complete single collection of
the kind that, up to that time, had been published.

Even Liebig is almost outdone by his French translator, M. de
Tchihatchef (Lord Bacon, Paris, and Ed. 1877). The following may
serve as choice examples of the indignation which Bacon arouses in

the breast of this modern philosopher ²³. ‘Paracelse erait presque

‘¹³ M. de chihatcbef has a wonderful faculty of blundering. The following is
such an amusing instance that 1 cannot refraiu from giving it. Sir Henry Savile,
