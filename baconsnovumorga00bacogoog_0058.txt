existence ot' bodies having positive levity. In lact, in Nov. Org. ii. 35,
he repeats, in almost the precise words ol Aristotle himself, the Aris-
totelian division ol what is called ‘motion ot' translation’ (φορά), and
sums up his account with the words ‘Atque ista pulchra dictu sunt’
And though, with respect to the circular and eternal motion ol the
heavenly bodies, he impugns Aristotle's theory in the Descriptio
Globi Intellectualis⁸', 1 arn not avare ol any passage in which it
appears to occur to him that the received division ol light and heavy,
and the two kinds of motion founded thereon‚ may be without
foundation ⁶⁴. At the same time, considering the obscurity ol the
views os motion which then prevalled, and the lact that the weight of
the atmosphere had not yet been discovered, we are not here so much
justified in complaining of ignorance, as of a want of that insight
which in a man of Bacon’s genius might possibly have been expected.
Connected with these opinions, are the theorias that air has no weight,
being indifferent as regards gravity and levity, and that llame and
‘living spirits' are positively light ⁸⁸.

Passing to a very different subject, we find that, ol the triad ol
Paracelsus, sulphur, mereury‚ and salt, Bacon adopts tvo principles,
namely sulphur and mercury, as pervading the universe (quasi per
universitatem rerum penneare)‚ and, apparently, as being the ulti-
mate elementa of matter (naturas admodum primordiales, et penitis-
slmos materiae schematismos, et inter Formas Primae Classis lere
praecipuas) ⁶⁶. The mode in which he traces these principles through
all things in heaven and earth and under the earth appears to us pecu-
liarly absurd. He omits Salt, as compounded oi the two others, but,
in doing so, can hardly be said to have improved on the theory of
Valentinus and Paracelsus. In two notes on Nov. Org. ii. 50 (6)

⁸* He certainly criticises the explanatione given (Nov. Org. ii. 35), but he does not
callia question the supposed laets themselves. It should, perhaps, also be meu·
tioned that he does not recognise in air and similar bodies ‘taurionis appetitus
petendi superiora, quam putatur! Historia Densi et Rari (E. aad S, vol. ii.
1>- 255)Ι

‘³ Animal spirits, as being compounded ol air and flama. are intermediate, in
point ol levity, between the two. See Historia Densi et Rari (E. and S„ vol. ii.
pp. 255, 256). ‘At spiritus vivos aere lpso aliquanto rariores existimamus: turn
qnia inflammantur nonnihi13 tum qnia diligenter experti sumus, aerem ad minu-
endam ant sublevandum pondus nihil consenc ...... nt corpus animale vivum
et mortuum gravitate manifesto differunt: licet haud tantum quantam putantur.
Quare videtur aer pondus non minuere; spiritus autem vivus hoc faeere!
