which are spoken of as ifthey were the sole sources at the beginning
of De Augrnentis, blo iii.

It is impossible not to see in these speculations, crude as some of
them are, the beginnings of much of the later English psychology

which became so famous in the hands of Ioclre, Hume, Reid, and
others. Besides the points already noticed 1 might also draw atten-
tion to the conception that Logic, Ethics, and Politics ought to be
treated inductively“, the striking contribution towards a theory of
Memory and Association which occurs in Novum Organum, ii. 26,
and, above all, the invaluable Aphorisms in the first book of the
Novum Organum on the Idola Tribus and the Idola Specus ³⁴.

Bacon’s Moral Philosophy is mainly contained in the seventh book
of the De Augmentis, and has, perhaps, hardly received the attention
which it deserves. As Logic treats of the Intellect, Ethics treats of
the Will“. ‘Voluntatem gubernat recta ratio, seducit bonum ap·
parens. Voluntatis stimuli affectus3 ministri, organa et motus
voluntarii.¹ Ethics may be divided into two principal doctrines, one
treating of the exemplar or image of good, the other (to which he
gives the fanciful title of ‘Georgica Animi ³) of the regulation and
culture of the mind He finds fault with previous philosophers for
not having carried their enquiries deeper, by searching for the roots
of good and evil, and the very fibres of those roots; ‘Ante omnia,
si Naturam Rerum non minus quam Axiomata Moralia consuluis-
sent, doctrinas snas minus prolixas, magis autem profundas reddi-
dissent “.’ Good is either public or private, and the appetite to
both these kinds of good is native to the human mind, and, indeed,
to everything which exists. ‘Inditus est atque impressus unicuique
rei appetitus ad duplicem Naturam Boni: alteram, qua res Totum
quiddam est in seipsa3 alteram, qua est Pars Totius alicujus Maj0ris.

³³ See Novum Orgnnnm. i. 1²7·

‘⁴ On the connexion between the mind and body, and the localisation of various
moral qualities and intellectnnl faculties, see n cnrious passage in De Augmentis,
iv. 1, especially towards the end.

²⁵ ln De Angmentis. vi. 3 (E. and S., vol. i, p. 671l, there is a good statement
of the respective ends of Logic and Ethics: ‘Finis enim Dialecticae est docere
formam argumentorum, ad praesidia intellectus, non ad insidias. Finis itidem
Ethicae affectus ita componere, nt rationi militent, non nutem earn invadant?

⁸⁸ At the same time. he nowhere expressly discusses the fundamental questions
of Morals, such as the grounds of Moral Obligation or the nature of the Mnral
Faculty, unless, indeed, we make an exception in favour of the few words devoted
rothe ‘ internus instinctus,' referred to just above.
