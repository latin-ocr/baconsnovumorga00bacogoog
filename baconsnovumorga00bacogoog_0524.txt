rectificant et dirigunt. Quodsi sint aliae instantiae quae
reliquos sensus juvent in ipsorum actionibus immediatis et .
individuis, tamen si ejusmodi sint quae informationi ipsi nihil
addant plus quam jam habetur, ad id quod nunc agitur non
faciunt. Itaque earum mentionem non fecimus.

Inter praerogativas instantiarum ponemus loco decimo
septimo Instantr'as Citantes⁴⁸, sumpto vocabulo a foris eivi-
libus, quia citant ea ut compareant quae prius non comparu-
erunt; quas etiam Instantius E vocantes appellare consuevimus.
Eae deducunt non-sensibile ad sensibile.

Sensum autem fugiunt res, vel propter distantiam objecti
locati ⁴⁹3 vel propter interceptionem sensus per corpora modia3
vel quia objectum non est habile ad impressionem in sensu
faciendam3 vel quia deficit quantum in objecto pro feriendo
sensu3 vel qula tempus aon est proportionatum ad aetuandum
sensum; vel quia objecti percussio non toleratura sensu ; vel

and declination of a star. The equatorial, the altitude and azimuth in·
strumene, and the theodolite, are instrumente which answer the same
purpose as the ancient astrolabe’ Brande and Cox's Dictionary of
Science, dcc. The tenn astrolabe is also employed to denote a plani-
sphere.

¹⁸ ‘The instantiae citantes enable us to perceive things which are in
themselves insensible, or not at all the objects of perception. They cite or
place things, as it were, before the bar of the sentes, and from this analogy
to judicial pmceedings is derived the name of instantiae citantes. Such, to
employ examples which the progress of science has unfolded since the time
of Bacon, are the air-pomp and the barometer for manifesting the weight
and elasticity of air; the measurement of the veloclty of light, by means
of the eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter, and the aberration of the fixed
stars; the experiments in electricity and galvanism, and in the greater part
of pneumatio chemistry. In all these instances things are made known
which before had entirely escaped the senses.¹ Playfair's Preliminary
Dissertation.

⁴⁸ The first and fourth of these cases are, at first sight, hardlydistinguish· ·
able from the ‘ Instantiae Januae.' But, when we come to the examples,
we find that Bacon has in mind objects which cannot be known in them·
selves but can be known only by means of indications, whereas in the
‘Instantiae Januae' the obJects themselves can be detected, provided we
have sufficiently powerful instruments.
