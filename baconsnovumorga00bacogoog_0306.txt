ltaque minime mirum est si scientiae non crescant, cum a
radicibus suis sint separatae.

Rursus se ostendit alia causa potens et magna, cur scientiae
parurn promoverint. Ea vero haec est; quod fieri non possit,
ut recte procedatur in curriculo, ubi ipsa meta non recte posita
sit et defixa. Meta autem scientiarum vera et legitima non
alia est quam ut dotetur vita humana novis inventis et copiis ²⁶.

prehensive manner than it was possible for the more special sciences to
do. lt was to give, as it were, a general survey of nature, and then the
more special sciences were to follow out 'in detail particular departments,
never, however, losing sight of the common stock with which they were
connected.

The inclusion of ‘affectus et prehensiones intell‘ectuales’ among the
objects of Natural Philosophy, though inconsistent with Bacon's employ-
ment of the word in the De Augmentis‚ is in accordance with ancient
usage. The word Psychology is comparatively modern, and the ques·
tions of which that sc'ience treats were included by ancient authors
under Physiology or Physics. Thus, the De Anima was always ranked
among the physical works of Aristotle. ln the old Statutes of the
University of Oxsord, among the books on which the ‘Praelector
Naturalis Philosophiae' was to lecture were the ‘libri de Anima! For
instances of the Aristotelian use of the words ‘physical’ and ‘ physio·
logical,' as including what we should call ‘psychological,’ see Eth. vii. 3
(9⁵1²)·

This, as l have pointed out in the introduction (pp. 129, 130, aud else·
where), is one of the watchwords of the Baconian philosophy. But we
must, at least, take it in conjunction with the maxim which Bacon is never
weary of repeating: ‘Lucifera experimenta, non fructifera quaerenda! It
often happens that enquiries which at first sight appear to have no prac-
tical bearing are ultimately found to contributa largely to the comforts
and conveniences of life. But, even if this were not the case, it might be
maintained, and maintained rightly, tha't knowledge should he sought for
its own sake. No reason can be given why man should not be at full
liberty to gratify his desire of knowledge, his curiosity to know all that is
about and within him, as much as any other desire of his nature. As
Bacon himself says in the Praise of Knowledge, ‘Are not the pleasures
of the affections greater than the pleasures of the senses? And are not
the pleasures of the intellect greater than the pleasures of the affectionsi
ls not knowledge a true and only natural pleasure, whereof there is no
satietyi'

On ‘the limits and end of knowledge,’ there is a long chapter in the
