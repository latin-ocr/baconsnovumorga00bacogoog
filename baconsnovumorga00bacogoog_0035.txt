6 INTRODUC T ION.

Μ. RELATION OF THE NOVUM ORGANUM TO THE MORE
IMPORTANT OF BACON'S OTHER PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS.

ΙΝ his letter to Father Fulgentio, which Mr. Spedding refers to
” 162 5¹, Bacon says: ‘Equidem memini me, quadraginta abhinc annis,
juvenile opusculum circa has res confecisse, quod magna prorsus
fiducia et magnifico titulo “Temporis Partum Maximum ” inscripsi’
This statement would shew that, at or about the early age of twenty-
five, Bacon had already begun to contemplate the Renovation of
Science. But the first form in which this idea occurred to him
seems to have been to write a great work on the Interpretation of
Nature, that is, on the new method of Induction¹. Of this pro
jected work, we have some fragments in Valerius Terminus, the
whole or the greater part of which seems to have been written about
1603 or 1604 ³. It is needless to add that Bacon’s idea was after-
wards far more fully carried out, in part at least, by the Novum
Organum. Of the much more extended scheme of the Great

Instauration in six parts, we have the first intimation⁴ in the Partis ·

Instaurationis Secundae Delineatio et Argumentum, which Mr.
Spedding thinks ‘may be referred with tolerable confidence to the
year 1606 or 1607 ζ’ and certainly to some time prior to the com-
position of the Cogitata et Visa, which, in its first form, seems to
have been composed in the summer or autumn of 16070. Both
these works are interesting as covering much of the same ground
as the Novum Organum, and may profitably be compared with it
and with one another.

Of the Great Instauration, no part, as Mr. Ellis truly says, can be
regarded as absolutely complete, though the first part, the Parti-
tiones Scientiarum, pointing out what had been done and what
remained to be done in the various sciences, is more adequately
represented than any other. This part is contained in the De Aug-
