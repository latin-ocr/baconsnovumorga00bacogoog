2 INTRODUCTION.

this course, 1 have assumed in my readers a certain amount of
acquaintance with the history oi philosophical speculation, as wellas
with the outlines oi logie. But to readers, who do not come to the
study oi the book with this amount oi acquirement, I cannot think
that an edition, worth the putting out, could be of any service.

The arrangement os the Sections bas been a matter of some
difficulty, as several os them stand in little relation to those that pre
cede or follow. On the whole, 1 have thought it most convenient,
keeping apart as iar as possible the expository sections from those
which are mainly historical, and bringing together those which stand
in any close connexion, to adopt the following order:

ξ 1. Dates oi the leading events in Bacon’s lile, and oi the first
publication os his principal writings.

§a The object oi the Novum Organum.

ξ 3. Relation of the Novum Organurn to the more important oi
Bacon’s other philosophica} works. “

§4 Was the Novum Organum written in Latin?

§5. Bacon's general philosophical opinions. ,

ἑὸ. Bacon's scientific attainments and opinions, with special
reference to the state os knowledge in his time.

cluding a note on the ‘Four Causes' oi Aristode).
