RELATION OF NEWTON TO BACON. 121

exercise, written in the above year, when Barrow was about aa
years of age, on the thesis Cartesiana hypothesis de maten'd et
motu haud satisfacit praeciptat naturae phoenomenis, he passes the
highest eulogium on Bacon, and shews, as Dr. Whewell says ¹⁰, ‘that
he had read the Novum Organum in a careful and intelligent manner,
and presumed his Cambridge hearers to be acquainted with the work?
The passages in this exercise, referring to bacon, ‘may be regarded‚¹
as Dr. Whewell also remarks, ‘as expressive of the opinions which
were then current among activeminded and studious young
men!

It would be superfluous to extend this enquiry beyond the point at
which we have now arrived, as, at the end of the seventeenth century,
we are already in the full tide of experimental research, when the fame
and influence of Bacon were, as I believe, universally acknowledged⁴¹.
But, before 1 proceed to consider the nature of this influence, it is
necessary that I should entertain aquestion which hasbeen the occa·
sion of considerable dispute, namely, the cause of the complete, and, as
it has seemed to some, singular silence with regard to bacon which
is maintained by his illustrious successor, Newton. Some refer it to
contemptuous indifference. Thus, Sir David Brewster‚ whose judg-
ment De Remusat accepts, roundly asserts that ‘Newton would have

enriched science with the same splendid discoveries‚ if the name and
the writings of Bacon had never been heard of,’ and says oddly

enough, as 1 have already pointed out, that ‘Boyle treated him with
the same disrespectful silence ⁴²! ’ On the other hand, Horace Wal-
pole‘³ calls Bacon ‘the Prophet of Arts, which Newton was sent
afterwards to reveal,’ and Reid“ speaks of Newton, as ‘having in
the third boolc of his Principia and in his Optics, had the rules of the
Novum Organum constantly in his eye! Between these conflicting
views I shall attempt to decide, considering‚ first, the external evi·
dence of Bacon's influence on Newton, secondly, the intemal evidence,
so far as it can be derived from Newton's own writings, and, lastly,
