Rursus vero homines a progressu in scientiis detinuit et
fere incantavit reverentia antiquitatis, 31 virorum, qui in
philosophia magni habiti sunt, authoritas, atque deinde con·
sensus. Atque de consensu superius dictum est ³⁴.

De antiquitate autern opinio, quam homines de ipsa fovent,

⁸⁴ Aph. 77. *Cp notes on that Aphorism, and also the passage in my

Inductive Logic (4th ed., pp. 287-295) there referredto. To the instaures
of extravagant respect for authority given in those placeS, the reader may
add the following taken from Galileo's 1st Dialogus (Sir Thomas Salus-
bury’s Translation‚ pp. 91-3).

‘Saenianus 1 found one day, 31 home in his house, at Venice, a
famous phisician, to whom some flockt for their studies, and others out of
curiosity sometimes came thither to see certain anatomies dissected by
the hand of a no lesse learned, than careful and experienced anatomist.

It chanced upon that day, when l was there, that he was in search of .

the original and rise of the nerves, about which there is 3 famous con-
troversle between the Galenists and Peripateticks ; and the anatomist
shewing, how that great number of nervas departing from the brain, as
their root, and passing by the nape of the neck, distend themselves after·
wards along by the back-bone, and branch themselves thorowall the body;
and that a very small filament, as fine as a thred, went to the beart;
he turned to a gentleman whom he knew to be a Peripatetick philosopher,
and for whose sake he had, with extraordinary exactnesse, discovered and
proved every thing, and demanded of him, if 133 was at length satistied and
persuaded that the original of the nerves proceeded from the brain, and

not from the beart? To which the philosopher, after he had stood musing ’

3 while, answered3 you have made me to see this business so plainly and
sensibly, that did not the text of Aristotle assert the contrary, which
positively affirmeth the nerves 1ο proceed from the beart, l should be

constrained to confesse your opinion to be true.¹

‘SnLvtnTth And there are certain gentlemen yet living, and in health,
who were present, when a doctor, that was professor in a famous aca-
demy, hearing the description of the telescope‚ by him not seen as then,
said that the invention was taken from Aristotle, and, causing his works to
be fetch’t, be turned to a place where the philosopher gives the reason,
whence it commem, that from the bottom of a very deep well one may see
the stars in heaven at noon day3 and, addressing himself to the company,
333 here, saith he, the well, which representeth the tube, see here thegross
vapours, from whence is taken the invention of the crystals‚ and 33313333
lastly the sight fortified by the passage of the rays through a diaphonous,
but more dense and obscure medium?

On the immoderate reverence for Antiquity and Authority, cp. De
Augrnentis, lib. i. (E. and S, vol. i. pp. 456-459). This passage, though
full of interest, is too long for quotation. “
