naturam datam ex sonte aliquo essentiae deducat quae inest
pluribus, et notior est naturae²⁹ (ut loquuntur) quam ipsa

‘essentia' constitute the ‘natura data! Thus, let us suppose, ior the sake
ot' example, that it would be possible to find a menstruum, or common
substance, capable, by the addition of various differentiae, oi becoming
gold, silver, copper, dcc. The menstruum or common substance would
represent the sons essentiae, and gold, silver‚ &c the naturae datae.
Thea, we might describe the ‘ionn' either as the attn'butes which, added
to the menstruum, constitute the natura data, or as the conditiora under
which the natura data is developed irorn the menstruum, or, which is only
another way ol speaking, as the law ol the process by which the meu·
struum is convened into the natura data

²⁹ That is, more general. See note 27 on Bk. i. Aph. aa. The proper
expression is natura notior.

³⁰ This expression requires qualification. See notes 2 5, 26 above.

³¹ ‘As oi a true genus.¹ The ‘genus verum' is the same as the ‘ natura
notius' or ‘ sons essentiae.⁹

³¹ See Bk i. Aphs. 81, 129, with the notes.

³³ One oi these modes oi transionnation proceeds by discovering the
various simple natures or qualities which determine the character oi the
body, and then superinducing thern one by one, till the body is constituted
(cp. Sylva sylvarum, Exp. 328); the other watches the latent process by
which the body is produced according to the ordinary way oi nature, and
then attempts to repeat it artificially. The artificiel production oi marble
by hrsion under pressure would be a good instance oi the latter mode
oi transionnation, as well as the various attempts, more or less successful
to produce artificial diamonds. For Bacon's sanguine expectations us
to the former mode, l cannot offer a better apology than that suggested
by Mr. Mill (Logia, bk. v. ch. 3. ξ 7): ‘Why should it not be possible
to make gold? Each oi the characteristic properties oi gold has itssorma,
its essence, its set of conditions, which ii we could discover, and learn how
to reabse, we could superinduco that particular property upon any other
substance, upon wood, or iton, or lime, or clay. li, then, we could effect
this with respect to every one oi the essential properties oi the precious
metal‚ we should have converted the other substance into gold. Nor did
