Wnar Bacon precisely means by this word ‘Form,’ is one of the
first questions which must occur to every reader of the Novum
Organum, and it is probably one os the last difficulties which will
be cleared from his path. I was at one time inclined to think that,
in various parts of his works, he attached to it two entirely distinct
meanings, which may be represented roughly by ‘cause’ and ‘essence,'
but, as will appear from the sequel, 1 am now of opinion that, though
the word has undoubtedly various shades of meaning indifferent
places, all these admit os derivation from a single conception. The

²⁴ For the sake oi those who are unacqnainted, or have only a slight acquaintance,
with the philosophy ol Aristotle, it is, perhaps, desirable that l should here give a
briei account oi the Aristotelian distinction ol the Four Causea. These are popu·
larly known as the Material, Formal, Final, and Efficient Causes. Their Greek
equivalents are respectiveiy: tor the Material Cause, ἡ ὕλη or τὸ ἔξ οὗ or τὸ
ὑποκείμενου ior the Formal Cansc, τὸ εἶδος or a) μορφή or τὸ ri ἦν εἶναι or τὸ
τί ἔστι or ἡ obsim for the Final Cause, τὸ οὗ ἕνεκα or τὸ τίνος {vem or τὸ
τέλοςς ior the Efficient Cause, τὸ ὅθεν ἡ ἀρχὴ τῆς κινήσεως or τι) ὅθεν ἡ κίνησις
or τὸ κινοῦν. Oi these, the Formal and Material Csuse can only be known in
relation to each other; thus, the block ol msrble, which is matter in relation
to the formed natue, itself has sorm in relation to the quarry from which it
was hewn, arrd this again in relation to the stuii out oi which it was formed,
aud so on, till we come to the πρώτη ὕλη or shapeless matter or matter
without lorm, which, however, is a mere mental abstraction, having no actual
existence. Nor is matter necessarily body. Thus tPhys. Il. 3), letters are the
matter os syllables, and the premissas the matter oi a syllogism. lt is simply
that on which lorm supervenes (τὸ τίνων ὄντων ἀνάγκη τοῦτο, sc the form, εἶναι,
Au. Post. ii. 11); and form supervening on matter brings into existence the finished
product, be it the statue, man, lit'e, mind, health. or what not. The efficient
cause is that by the instrumentality oi which form supervenes upon matter,
as, for instance, in the case os the statue, the sculptor, or, in the case os health,
the medical art, or, in the case ol the universe at large, God or νοῦς. The
final cause (and it is always assumed by Aristotle that there is one; οὐδὲν
μάτην i) φίισις ποιεῖ) is that lor which the object exists, the end it subserves, aS,
sor instance, in the case oi a statue, the pleasure or improvement ol man, in the
caseos the bones os an animal, the support ol the body and the protection os its
soster paris, in the case ol the state, the wallare os the citizens, and so on.

The student who requires iurther information should consult Ueberweg, Zeller, or
some other History oi Philosophy. lle should also read, with special attention,
Phys. ii. 3 (repeated in Metaph. iv. ( .) a), Metaph. i. 3, and An. Post. ii. 11. On
the question of the coincidences which sometimes exist amongst these Causea, and
other difficulties, 1 have not entered. Nor do 1 think it would be os any service to
draw out the differences of meaning in these terms as employed by Bacon and as
employed by Aristone. The student, who is even moderately acquainted with both
authors, cau easily, it he has the curiosity, do this work lor himself.
