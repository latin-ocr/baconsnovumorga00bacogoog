in the notes on the various details of Bacon’s method in the order
in which they occur in the text, it is unnecessary that I should here
do more than make a few very brief and general remarks.

Bacon was undoubtedlyinclined to underrate the syllogism,that is to
say, deductive reasoning, but then we must recollect that he regarded
it as his special province to bring out the other side of reasoning, the
inductive brancb by which general principles are established rather
than applied. Nor would it be true to say that he ignored the deduc·
tive side of reasoning altogether. Whenever he saw, as he often did
see, its value for the purpose of applying the truths already arrived at
by induction, he seems without hesitation to have assigned it a co
ordinate rank. witness, amongst many otherS, the following pas
sages: ‘Majora vero speranda a nova luce axiomatum, ex particu-
laribus illis certa viaet regula eductorum, quae rursus nova parti·
cularia indicent et designent. Neque enim in plano via sita est, sed
ascendendo et descendendo ; ascendendo primo ad axiomata, de·
scendendo ad operatu! ‘Mathematica philosophiam naturalem
terminare * * * * debet⁵⁶.’ The seventh os the ‘reliqua auxilia
intellectus' (Nov. Org. ii. 21), which were to succeed the Tables,
was to be entitled ‘Deductio ad Praxin!

The charge against Bacon os having, to a certain extent, detracted
from the value os his method by depreciating hypothesis and neglect·
ing to lay down rules forits legitimate employment, must undoubtedly
be admitted. But then we may plead in extenuation his admission,
however inconsistent, of hypothesis (‘ Permissio Intellectus ') inii. 20,
as also in i. 106, and the gross license with which, both in his time and
for some time afterwards, this procedure was employed. If Bacon
is to be censured in this particular, as he undoubtedly is to be, the
censure ought in all fairness to be extended to Newton as well.

The method, recommended by Bacon, of gradual ascent from
particular facts, through axioms of successive degrees of generality, up
to the highest generalisations of all ⁵⁷, though not, as I conceive, the
method which has been usually followed by scientific investigators, or
that which would be most likely to contribute to the progress of
science, is, certainly, the most convenient mode of representing the
laws of nature, when once established. Moreover, the successive
steps which led up to, and ultimately established, the Theory of
