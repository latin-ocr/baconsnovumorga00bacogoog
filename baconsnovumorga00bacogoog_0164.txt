Unnsn this head, 1 propose only to give some examples of the
various grounds of opposition or disparagement to which the
Baconian philosophy has been subjected, thinking that, though sar
from exhaustive, they will be os some interest to the reader.

Perhaps, I ought first to notice a letter from Sir Thomas Bodley
(originally published in Bacon's Remains, 1648, pp. 85-87), ‘to Sir
Francis Bacon, about his Cogitata et Visa, wherein he declareth his
opinion lreely touching the same.5 The writer, who has evidently a
great affection ior the old learning, is somewhat scandalised by Bacon's
revolutionary sentiments, and thinks thetis we ‘come babes‘ad
regnum naturae, as we are willed by Scriptores to come ad regnum
coelorum, there is nothing more certain than that it would instantly
bring us to Barbarism, and aster many thousand years leave us more
unprovided of theoricall sumiture than we are at this present! The
letter is interesting, but it betrays bewilderment and an incapacity to
understand Bacon's dissatissaction with the existing state os things
or a reionn in the sciences such as he projected. It has, in recent
times, been disinterred from oblivion by De Maistre and other
antagonists ol Bacon.

Far more pertinent is the unfavourable opinion os Bacon’s philo
sophy expressed by Harvey, as given in Aubrey's Lives (letters
wntten by Eminent Persons in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth
Centuries, to which are added Lives os Eminent Men by John
Aubrey Esq.‚ 1813, vol. ii. p. 381) : ‘He' (Harvey) ‘had been phy-
sician to the Lord Ch. Bacon, whom he esteemed much for his witt
and style, but would not allow him to be a great philosopher. Said
he to me, “He writes philosophy like a L(l Chanceller,” speaking
in derision’ Harvey, however, seems to have had a peculiar dislike
os the ‘neoteriques,' to whom, we are told on p. 383, he once, in
conversation with the writer, applied a very unsavoury epithet Nor,
