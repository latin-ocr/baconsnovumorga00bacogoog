Verum non solum quaerenda est mensura motuum et actio ,
num simpliciter, sed multo magis comparative: id enim eade-.-
est usus, et ad plurima spectat. Atque videmus flammam a*

necesse sit pilam prius aerem percutere, quam flamma q&

Etiam ex hoc fundamento inaequalitatis motuum quoac'

³⁸ l think that Bacon must here have in mind cosmical clouds, in tle
interstellar spaces, not ordinary or aerial clouds. The argument is tha·
the light of the stam, if it took a long time for its transmission, would he
frequently stopped by various obstacles in the sky, whereas, on a clear
night, we invariably see the stars where we expect to find them. Ar the
same time, it must be confessed that, if there were such obstacles as l arn
supposing Bacon to contemplate, the light might sometimes be intercepted
however instantaneous its transmission. There is, then, an umdoubted
difficulty in the passage, though it does not appear to me so great asir
seems to appear to Mr. Spedding.

³⁹ The retention of images on the retina of the eye is a familiar pheno
menon, of which the reader will easily supply himself with instantes The l
duration of the persistence varies with the intensity of the light and the
sensitiveness of the organ. ‘M. Platean has investigated the duration of
the impression by numerous methods, and has found that it is on the
average half a second. s s s A great number of pieces of apparatus are
founded on the persistence of sensation on the retina. Such are the ,
thaumatrope‚ the phenalristoscope, Faraday’s wheel, the kaleidophone, ¹
and the zoetrope.' Ganots Physica, rath Ed, ξ 625. ¹

⁴⁰ Mr. Ellis says that ⁴ in the case of vibrating strings Bacon's explana-
tion is not altogether complete. The distinctor quasi-distinct images to
which he refers correspond to limiting positions of the vibrating suing’

⁴¹ ‘This account of Galileo's theory of the tides is inaccurate ln this
theory the tides are caused by the varying velocity of different points of
the earth's surface, arising from the composition of the earth's two
motions‚ namely that about its axis, and that iu its orbit Bacon does not
seem to have perceived that both these motions are essential to the ’
