astronomy, it denoted the great circle which is approximatcly the projection

on the sphere oi the moon's orbit. The ascending node was called the
caput draconis, and the descending the cauda draconis. The same terms
were occasionally applied to the nodes of the planetary orbits. It is not
improbable that Bacon intended to complain oi the rejection oi spirals
oi double curvatum, or helices, which, traced on the suriace oi the sphere,
might represent inequalities in latitude. Compare (Nov. Org. ii. 48)
what is said oi the variatione oi which the “motus rotationis spontaneus’'
admits'

Cp. a passage in the De Augmentis, lib. iii. cap. 4 (E. and S., vohi.
p. 552), where Bacon complains: ‘At vix quisquamst, qui inquisivit
causas physicas tum dc . . . . tum de motuum obliquatione, vel per spiras se
versus tropicos texendo et retexendo, vel per sinuationes quas Dracones
vocant! '

⁶¹ The four elements were imagined as having each its natural place,
earth being lowest and fire highest. As the orbos tire is above that oi
air, it is too remote irorn usto bean object ol sense.

⁰² This doctrine which prevailed throughout the Schools, though entirely
unsupported by evidence and even in spite oi the evidence oi the senses,
owes its origin to a mistaken interpretation οἱ a passage in Aristotle,
De Generatione et Corruptione, ii. 6 (p. 333 a. 16-34). The student, on
referring to the passage, will find that the ‘decupla ratio' is only put
hypothetically, sor the sake of example: ‘olor εἶ ἐξ ὕδατος κοτύλης εἷεν
ἀέρος de'ro3⁸ ‘olor εἶ κοτύλη ὕδατος ἴσον livam ψύχειν ml δέκα ἀέρος.ἱ
The order ol the elements would, ot' course, be earth, water, air, tire. A
fifth clement was added by Aristotle and the Peripatetics, which was
regarded as peculiar to the celestial regions and as being the material
of which the heavenly bodies were composed. lt was called aether. See,
ior instance, Meteorologica, i. 33 De Coelo, i. 3. Cp. note on the words
‘ut Gilbertus' in ii. 36 (5).

anthropomorphic conceptione oi God, and the manner in which we attri-
bute to Nature designs and modes oi operation analogous to those which
we experience amongst men.
