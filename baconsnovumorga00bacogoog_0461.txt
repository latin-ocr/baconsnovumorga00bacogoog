432 NOVUM ORGANUM.

Similiter, exempli gratia3 sit natura inquisita Gustus, sive
Gustatio. Instantr'ae quae sequuntur sunt Constitutivae: vide-
licet, quod qui non olfaciunt, sed sensu eo a natura destituti
sunt, non percipiant aut gustu distinguant cibum rancidum
aut putridum, neque similiter alliatum aut rosatum, aut hu-
jusmodi ⁷⁵. Rursus, illi, qui per accidens nares habent per
descensum rheumatis obstructas, non discernunt aut percipiunt
aliquid putridum aut rancidum aut aqua rosacea inspersum.
Rursus, qui afficiuntur huj usmodi rheumate, si in ipso moment0,
cum aliquid foetidum aut odoratum habent in ore sive palat0,
emungant fortiter, in ipso instanti manifestam perceptionem
habent rancidi vel odorati. Quae instantiae dabunt et consti-
tuent hanc speciem, vel partem potius gustus3 ut sensus
gustationis ex parte nihil aliud sit quam olfactus interior,
transiens et descendens a narium meatibus superioribus in os
et palatum ⁷⁶. At contra, salsum et dulce et acre et acidum
et austerum et amarum, et similia, haec (inquam) omnia
aeque sentiunt illi in quibus olfactus deest aut obturatur, ac
quisquam alius3 ut manifestum sit sensum gustus esse com-
positum quiddam ex olfactu interiori et tactu quodam
exquisito ⁷⁷3 de quo nunc non est dicendi locus.

Similiter, exempli gratia ; sit natura inquisita Communicatio

'¹⁶ These instances are, perhaps, slightly exaggerated. But, so far as
they are true, they are well explained by the following extract from Prof.
Bain's ‘Senses and Intellect' 3rd Ed, pp. 158-9: ‘Tastes, pmperly so
called, allect only the gustatory nerves‚ and are therefore the same
whether the nostrils are opened or closed. But many sapid bodies are
also odorous. ln the act of expiratlon accompanying mastication, especi-
ally the instant after deglution, the odorous particles are carried into the
cavities of the nose‚ and aflect the sense of smell, or make their odour
apparent. This effect is what we term flavour. Some bodies, as
cinnamon, have hardly any caste, but a flavour, in other words an odour,
brought out by mastication!

⁷⁸ lt must be borne in mind, however, that, though the sensatione ol
smell and taste are closely associated, and their organs are in close
proximity, they are still perfectly distinct.

⁷⁷ In the caseol both taste and smell, the precise mode ol action on the
organ is very obscure, but, in each case, it is probably chemical. Touch
is, of course, a condition common to all the five extsmal senses, various as
they are in their characteristics, and impossible as it is to reduce them, one
to the other.
