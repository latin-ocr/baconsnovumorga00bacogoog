(which has been frequently reprinted) first appeared in 17² 5, in his
English Edition 01 Bacon’s works. One made by Mr. W. Wood was
embodied in Montagu's Edition (London, Pickering, 1831), and
reprinted by Pickering in a separate form in 1844, and, again, in
Bohn's Series (Ed. Devey), 1853. A translation 01 the First Book
only was printed 101 private circulation by Μ1. Glasslord, Edinburgh‚
1844. Dr. Kitchin's Translation appeared in 1855 (Oxford, Clarendon
Press), that contained in the 4111 vol. 01 Ellis and Speddings Edition
in 1858 ³¹, and, lastly‚ Mr. Andrew Johnson’s (Bell and Daldy)

It should be noticed that 10 English epitome 01 the Novum Orga-
num ‘translated and taken out 01 the latin by M.D. B.D.’ was
published in 1676 at the end 01 the tenth Edition 01 the Sylva
Sylvarum, and was reprinted in the subsequent editions 01 that
work.

inspection⁷⁹, only 01 those 01 lasalle (OEuvres de Franpois Bacon,
Chancellier d'Angleterre, traduites par A. lasalle, Dijon, An 8
[1800]), and 01 Μ. Lorquet, which contains only Book i. and portions
01 Book ii. The latter work, which is bound up with extracto from
Descartes and Leibnita is an Ouvrage autorise par le conseil royal
de l'instruction, and was published at Paris in 1847.

In the Pantheon Litteraire, there is a collection 01 the OEuvres
Philosophiques‚ Morales, et Politiques de F 11ος011 Bacon in Erench
by J. A. C. Buchon, Paris, Desrez, 1838. The translation 01 the
Novum Organum is taken 11010 lasalle. The same translation
re-appears, with occasional corrections, and a few meagre notes, 10
the less complete collection 01 the OEuvres de Bacon, Traduction
revue, corrigee, &c., by F. Riaux, 2 vols. Paris, 1843 ⁸⁰.

” In the First Edition, I wrongly ascribed this translation to Μ1. Headlam,
having misinterpretod the account given 01 itin Μ1. Spedding’s ‘ History and Plan
01 this Edition ¹ prefixed to the First Volumc 01 E. and S. Μ1. Spedding aiter·
wards informed me that the translation was originally made by an Undergraduate
olTrinity Collega. Cambridge, but that he was himself responsible 101 the 101111
which it ultimately assumed.

'' 11. Bouillet refers to a work entitled ‘Fragmens extraits des ceuvres du chau·
cellier Bacon, tradults de l'edition anglaise de P. Sbaw,’ by Mary Dumoulin, Paris
and Amsterdam, 1765, but 1 have not been ableto find this book even in the
Bibliothtque Nationale. It seems, amongst other things, to 10011111 a good
analysis 011111 Novum Organum. See Bouillet, tome ii. Introd.‚ p. lii.
