of England, Scotland, and Wales, historically related, according to
the precepts of the Lord Bacon ς’ together with many other writers
whom it would be tedious to enumerate.

The authorities cited are, however, amply sufficient to prove the
two points which I was anxious to establish: rst, that the foundation
of the Royal Society in England, and possibly also that of some
similar societies on the Continent, was due to the impulse given by
Bacon to the study of experimental science and the pians which he
devised for its prosecution; and, that some of the more eminent men
who were amongst the earliest members of that society, Wallis, Boyle,
Hoolre, dre, were deeply imbued with the spirit of Bacon's teaching,
and ready fully to recognise their obligations to him. If these facts
be established, as 1 think they are, there can be no question as to the
reality of Bacon’s influence on the progress of science in the generation
immediately succeeding his own, whatever we may regard the nature
of that influence as having been ³⁸.

Nor was the ‘New Philosophy' without its influence on the Uni-
versities, much as those bodies were occupied at this time with other
questions, and deeply rooted as were their prejudices in favour of
the old learning. Even if we pass over the Letter of the University
of Oxford³⁷, written on receipt of Bacon's De Augmentis in 1623, in
which he is likened to a literary Hercules, who has further advanced

the pillars of learning, deemed by others immovable, as savouring,
perhaps, too much of official flattery ; and even if we reject, as testi-

mony to himself, and, therefore, perhaps, partial, what he says in his
letter to the King³⁸ about the reception of the Advancemeut of

the most flattering straim but, as Mr. Napier remarks, ‘this piece of homage was
offered ut a time when ull motives to interested adulatiou had been done away by
Becon's lamentable tall? The following is a specimen of the languuge of this
letter: 'Creveruut quidem [musae], et sub calamo tuo, qui, tunquam strenuus lite·
