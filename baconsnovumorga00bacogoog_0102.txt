REACTION AGAINST ARISTOTLE. 73

in the schools of the Middle Ages, the gradual diffusion oi his works,
the predominant influence which, as a rule, he exercised, or the
occasional protests‚ followed sometimes by authoritative decrees,
which, on theological grounds, were directed against that intluence ⁶2.
Nor shall 1 describe the treatment which, as the supposed source of
the scholastic dogmas, the Aristotelian philosophy received at the
hands oi the Resormers, who, with the one exception os Melanchthon, ’
so bitterly, and ollen so ignorantly, opposed it. As illustrating the
position os Bacon, Iam concemed solely with the philosophical
reaetion against the Aristotelian method and doctrine, and this it
may be interesting to the reader to see exemplified at some length.

Even so early as the twelsth century, we find John of Salisbury ,
(b. about 1120, d 1180) thinking it necessary to wam his readers
that Aristotle had ‘erred in many things! ln the curious and
interesting treatise, entitled ‘ Metalogicus' he grants, on the one hand,
that Aristotle was preeminently ‘the philosopher,’ and, in the art
oi dialectic at least, excelled all others: ‘Sed cum singuli suis meritis
splendeant, omnes se An'stotelis adorare vestigia gloriantur, adeo
quidem ut commune omnium philosophorum nomen praeeminentia
quadam sibi proprium feeerit. Nam et autonomatice, idest excel-
lenter, philosophus appellatur ’Β On the other hand, while re
commending the study os Aristotle rather than Boethius, he adds:
‘Nec umen Aristotelem ubique plane aut sensisse aut dixisse
protestor, ut sacrosanctum sit, quidquid scripsit Nam in pluribus,
obtinente ratione et auctoritate fidei, convincitur errasse: siquidem
non modo studiosum quemlibet, sed et Deum ipsum prava posse
committere asserit. * * * * * * Sunt et multi errores ejus, qui in
scripturis tam ethnicis quam fidelibus poterunt inveniri ; verum in
logica parem habuisse non legitur. Unde sic accipiendus est, ut ad
promovendos juvenes ad gravioris philosophiae instituta doctor sit,
non morum, sed disceptationum Ψ

In the next century, Roger Bacon (b. 1214, d. 1292 or 4) used
language oi a similar purport, shewing at once a discriminating
