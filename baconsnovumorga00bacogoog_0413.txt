5. Non invenitur in partibus animalium, postquam suerint
mortuae aut separatae, aliquid calidum ad tactum humanum.
Nam neque fimus equinus ipse, nisi fuerit conclusus et sepul-
tus, calorem retinet. Sed tamen omnis fimus habere videtur
calorem potentialem, ut in agrorum impinguatione. Et simi-
liter, cadavera animalium hujusmodi habent latentem et po·
tentialem calorem; adeo ut in coemeteriis, ubi quotidie fiunt
sepulturae, terra calorem quendam occultum colligat, qui
cadaver aliquod recenter impositum consumit longe citius
quam terra pura ³⁵. Atque apud orientales traditur inveniri
textile quoddam tenue et molle, factum ex avium plumagine,
quod vi innata butyrum solvat et liquefaciat in ipso leviter
involutum.

6. Quae impinguant agros, ut limi omnis generis, creta,
arena maris, sal, et similia, dispositionem nonnullam habent
ad calidum.

7. Omnis putrefactio in se rudimenta quaedam exilis caloris

cause· We should be greatly deceived if we referred only to sensation
as an indication 01 the presence of this cause. Many 01 those things which
excite in our organs, and especially those of taste, a sensation of beat,
owe this property to chemical stimulants, and not at all to their being
actually hot. This error 01 judgment has produced a corresponding con·
fusion 01 language, and hence bad actually at one period crept into physical
philosophy a great many illogical and absurd conclusions. Again, there
are a number of chemieal agents, which, from their corroding, blacken-
ing, and dissolving, or drylng up the parts 01 some descriptions of bodies,
and producing on them effects not generally unlilre (though intrinsically
very different from) those produced by beat, are said, in loose and vulgar
language, to burn them ; and this error has even become rooted into
a prejudice, by the fact that some of these agents are capable 01 becoming
actually and truly lrot during their action on moist substances‚ by reason of
their combination with the water the latter contain. Thus, quicklime and
oil of vitriol both exercise a powerful corrosiva action on animal and
vegetable substances‚ and both become violently hot by their combination
with water. They are, therefore, set down in vulgar parlance as sub·
stances 01 a hot nature; whereas, in their relations to the physical cause of
beat, they agree with the generality of bodies similarly constituted.²

⁵⁵ There is no ground, 1 believe, for this assertion. The idea may have
been suggested by the effects of quick-lime, which was frequently strewn
on corpses, during the time of plague, in hastening decomposition, not
only at the time 01 being strewn but subsequently. Moreover, bodies are
consumed much more quickly in some soils than others.
