autem ait, herbam vocatam Rorem solon me'ridie et fervente
sole rore impleri, cum aliae herbae undique sint siccae. At
nos utramque narrationem fabulosam esse existimamus. Om-
nino autem illae instantiae nobilissimi forent usus, et intro-
spectione dignissimae, si essent verae. Etiam rores illos
mellitos, et instar mannae, qui super soliis quercus inveniuntur
mense Maio, non existimamus fieri et densari a consensu
aliquo, sive a proprietate solii quercus; sed, cum super aliis
soliis pariter cadant, contineri scilicet et durare in soliis quer-
cus, quia sunt bene unita, nec spongiosa, ut plurima ex aliis ²³.

The story may have originated in the observatiou of some plant which
exudes moisture. Such plants are not uncommon‚ as, ior instance, the
Pitcher Plant, some oi the Musas, the Drosera, next mentioned, dte. Or
the plant may have been one ou which dew is easily deposited and te·
tained. Or, lastly, the cause might be the constant exudations oi small
insecta. Mr. Andrew Johnson, who adopts this view, quotes Livingstone’s
Travels in South Attica, p. 415: ‘l badan opportunity oi observing a
curious insect which inhabits trees os the figiamily (ficus). Seven or eight
of them cluster round a spot on one of the smaller branches, and there
keep up a constant distillation ol a clear fluia, which dropping to the
ground tonns a little puddle below. li a vessel is placed under them in
the evening, it contains four or five piuts ol tluid in the morning.'
ltlr. Johnson adds: ‘A careless observer might easily suppose this fluid
to be the production of the trec itself!

Lasalle has a long note on this passage. He quotes, in support oi the
story ol the cloud hanging over the tree, an English navigator, one Robert
Lade, and supplements the evidence by an observation oi his own, in which
he saw detached masses ol sog clinging to the tops oi trees. But Cardan's
story seems to imply more than this rationalistic explanation oi it.

⁹² The Drosera (δροσερά) or Suu-Dew. The glande os the leaves exude
drops oi a clear glutinous tluid, glittering like dew-drops, whence the
name.

Mr. Ellis says: ‘l have not been ableto lind this in Paraoelsus. lt
seems, however, to accord with his theory os dew,—namely, that it is an
exudation from the sun and stars; the suppression oi which would lead to
the formation ol additional suns.¹

²³ The honey·dew on the oak, lime, rose-trec, plum-tree, δια, is in all
probability due to a sugary enudation lrom the Aphis. For a description
oi this insect, its devastations‚ and its exudations, see the Rev. J. G. Wood's
insects at Home, p. 542, &a

None os the three examples adduced by Bacon, it will be noticed, are
really instances oi ‘ condensation.’ The phenomena all arise from exuda-
tiou, either ol the plant itseli or ol au insect settling on the plant.
