16 INTRODUC T ION.

'Ibe fact is that Bacon lived too early or too late to take any serious
part in these metaphysical discussions. In their scholastic form they
had become discredited, and their new form, under which they were to
exercise so much of the best thought of the two succeeding centuries,
had not yet been impressed on them by the genius of Descartes.
Bacon assumes the ordinary distinction of mind and matter, an
universe of objects to be known anda thinking subject capable, with
due care and discipline, of attaining to a knowledge of them, without,
apparently, troubling himself as to the ulterior questions, what is
knowledge, how can I become conscious of that which is not myself,
and what are the ultimate meaning and relation of the two terms in
this comparison

On questions of psychology, as distinct from metaphysics, we find
a fair number of passages in Bacon's writings The most important
perhaps of these are those in which, following Telesiusfl, he asserts
the duality of the human soul. Man, according to this doctrine (which
is stated most fully in De Augrnentis, iv. 3), has two souls, one
peculiar to himself, the rational sonl which he derives from the
breath of God, the other, shared by him in common with the brutes,
the irrational soul, which comes from ‘the wombs of the elements.’
‘Veniamus ad doctrinam de Anima Humana 3 e cujus thesauris
omnes caeterae doctrinae depromptae sunt Ejus duae sunt partes3
altera tractat de Anima Rationali‚ quae divina est ; altera de Irra-
tionali, quae communis est curn brutis. Notavimus autem paulo
superius (ubi de Formis loquebamur) differentes illas duas Anima-
rum emanationes, quae in prima utriusque creatione se dant conspici-
endas; nimirum, quod altera ortum habuerit a Spiraculo Dei, altera e
Matricibus Elementorum. Nam de Animae Rationalis generatione
primitiva ita ait Scriptura, Firmani! hominem de limo terrae, et spr'ravit
in faciem ejus spr'raculum vitae. At generatio Animae IrrationaliS‚
sive Brutorum, facta est per verba illa, Producat aqua,· Producat

terrm· haec autem Anima (qualis est in homine) Animae Rationali
organum tantum est, atque originem habetet ipsa quoque, quemad-
modum in brutis, elimo terrae. Neque enim dictum est, Formanit
corpm komr'nisde lineo terrae, sed Fomanitkominem ,· integrum scilicet
hominem, excepto illo spiraculo. Quamobrem partem primam doc-
trinae generalis „eirca Animam Humanam, doctrinam de Spiraculo
