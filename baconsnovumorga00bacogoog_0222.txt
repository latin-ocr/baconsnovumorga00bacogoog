Solent se immiscere naturae (quoad opera ⁵) mechanicus,

⁰ Dr. Kitchin has the following note: ‘As to the Machanician, the
Mathematician and the Physician, Bacon's remarks were being salsified at
the very time he wrote.-.Mechanics had produced tlycloclrs, telescopes,
and other usesul contrivances.—Mathematics boasted of KeplerandGalileo;
and the discoveries oi Harvey and Gilbert were opening out a new world
ior Medical research. But Bacon could scarcely have discemed all this,
and his jealousy¹ (or, as l should rather say, distrust) ‘oi his contem-
poraries (cp. 1. 54) would scarcely have allowed him to acknowledge
their worth. Resides this he was utterly ignorant os Mathematics (see
Hallam, Lit. Eur. vol. ΙΙ. iii. 3. ξ 78). Alchemy was certainly thoroughly
empirical and saulty; sor “at this time Chemistry seemed to have an
elective attraction ior everything that was absurd and uniounded.” (Play-
iair.) And Magic‚ which still exerted great intluence, was as bad. Sir
T. Browne, Rel. Med. i. 31, gives some account os it; which is worth
consulting, as it gives the views oi a physician and contemporary oi
Bacon. Cp. also De Augm. Selii. 5, and Adv. ol Leaming, Bk. ii'

ln Aph. 85, Bacon distinguishes between Natural and superstitious
Magio. Natural Magic is treated in the De Augmentis, lib. iii. cap. 5, as
supplementary to the Inquisition os Forms, and vindicated‚ when dis·
tinguished irorn the ‘false and ignoble kind‚' as a legitimate branch of
enquiry. ‘Si igitur desiderari eam partem Metaphysieae quae de Formi&
agitposuimus‚ sequiturutNaturalis etiam Magia, quae adeamest relativa,
similiter desideretur. Verum hocloco postulandum videtur, ut vocabulum
istud Magia, in deteriorem partem jampridem acceptum, antiquo et
honorifico sensui restituatur. Etenim Magia apud Persas pro sapientia
sublimi, et scientia consensuum rerum universalium, accipiebatur; atque
etiarn tres illi reges, qui ab Oriente ad Christum adorandum venerunt,
Magonem nomine vocabantur. Nos vero eam illo in sensu intelligimus,
ut sit scientia quae cognitionem Formarum Abditamm ad opera ad·
miranda deducat; atque, quod dici solet, actr'va cum passivis conjungendo
magnalia naturae manifestet!

The substance ol this Aphon'sm, greatly expanded‚ occupies the two
first paragraphs os the Cogitata et Visa. These paragraphs are too long
to be extracted, but they may be read by the student with advantage.
