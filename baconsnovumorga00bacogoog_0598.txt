LIB. II. 49. 569

Etiam canones praedominantiarum qui occurrunt colligendi
sunt. Veluti, quodquo communius est bonum quod appetitur,
eo motus est fortior⁸¹z ut motus nexus, qui respicit commu-
nionem universi, fortior est motu gravitatis, qui respicit com·
munionem densorum. Etiam quod appetitus qui sunt boni
privati, non praevalent plerunque contra appetitus boni magis
publici, nisi in parvis quantis. Quae utinam obtinerent in
civilibus.

make much the greater impression 01 the two. But, as it is almost need-
less to add, Bacon entirely mistook the conditions 01 the problem.

The true theory of the motion of projectiles was first distinctly enun-
ciated by Galileo in the fourth of his Dialogues on Motion, which were
published at Leyden in 1638 (Dialoghi delle N uove Scienze‚ Giomata iv,
F lorence Ed, vol. xiii. p. 222, dre). On the previous speculations 01
Tartaglia, Digges, dre, see Whewell’s History of the Inductive Sciences,
vol. ii. blr. vi. ch. 2. sect. 3, and Drinkwater’s Life 01 Galileo (Lib. Soc.
U. Κ.), ch. 16. lt is curious that one 01 the books (the Pantometria,
published in 1591), in which Thomas Digges alludes to the compounded
motion 01 2 projectile‚ was dedicated to Sir Nicholas Bacon‚ Bacon's
father. A series of very interesting remarks on this subject will be found
at the end of the Stratioticos, published by Digges in 1579.

⁸¹ Note this strange application 01 the doctrine of Final Causas, and the
very doubtful example by which it is supported.

On Public and Private Good, cp. the interesting passages in De Augm.
vii. 1 (E. and S.‚ vol. i. p. 717, dre), or Advancement 01 Learning, bk. ii.
(E. and S.‚ vol. iii. p. 420, 1110). The application of this distinction to
‘judge and determine the controversies wherein Moral Philosophy is
conversant’ hasa peculiar interest in reference to subsequent ethical
speculation.

⁸² These are the first of the three ‘Instantiae propitiae sive benevolae’
(see Apb. 44). Their office is ‘dirigere operativam ad ea quae maxime
hominum intersunt! Hence, they are called ‘lntimating Instances ;' for
they suggest to us what are profitable, and what are unprofitable directions
for our experiments, energies, or speculations.

⁸³ On the necessity 01 the union of Knowledge and Praetice, Science
and Art, see i. 81, ii. 4, and the various other passages on the same subject
which abound in this treatise. In i. 3, the lesson is conveyed in a some·
what different form : ‘Scientia et potentia humana in idem coincidunt.’
