PRESENT VALUE OF BACON’S LOGICAL WORKS. 131

Shakspeare, who is so easily remembered or so frequently quoted.
His phraseology, when most quaint, as in the case os the ‘Idols 'and
the ‘Instances,' is often most attractive to the reader and most per-
sistent in its hold on the memory. Hence, too, perhaps, it is that
there is no author so stimulating. Bacon might well be called the
British Socrates. Even had his individual precepts been utterly
worthless, many men must have owed their first impulse to the
study os nature, orto independent investigation in general, to the
terse and buming words, issuing, as it were, from the lips ol an
irresistible commander, with which he urges them to the work.

Such, I conceive, are the principal modes and directions in which
the influence ol Bacon was exercised. It would be easy to add to
these, but they will readily suggest others, and the limits of this
work necessarily compel me to aim at brevity rather than ex-
pansron.

Trrrs subject has already, toa great extent, been discussed in the
latter part ol the last section, and it will be unnecessary here to add
much to what has there been said. The two questions, however,
ol Bacon’s influence during the past, and the value os his works to‘
the student at the present time, seem to be so distinct as to require
separate treatment, however much they may run into each other.

The intrinsic value oi Bacon's logical works to the student at the
present time, apart from their historical interest, as having, to adopt
the fine saying os Macaulay, ‘moved the intellects which have moved
the world,' may be briefly considered under two aspects. The first
is their general effect in guarding, stimulating, and disciplining the
intellect; the second is the amount of definite logical doctrine,
comprised in them, which retains any permanent value.

With regard to the first point, I know no work ol the same kind
so stimulating to a young render, or so likely to foster habits oi
cautious and independent investigation, as the First Book ottho
Novum Organum. What Bacon says of Plato is pre-eminently true
os himself. He was ‘a man osa sublime genius, who took a view of
everything as from a high rock ⁵³! Now to the young student nothing
is ol so much importance as to be brought into contact with worksof
