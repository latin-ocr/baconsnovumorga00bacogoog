Qualitatis absque Commistione Substantiae. Instantis Lucis
dabit vel constituet unam speciem communicationis; Calor
vero et Magnes alteram. communicatio enim lucis est
tanquam momentanea, et statim perit, amota luce originali.
At calidum et virtus magnetica, postquam tramissa fuerint
vel potius excitata in alio corpore, haerent et manent ad
tempus non parvum, amoto primo movente.

Denique magna est omnino praerogativa instantiarum con·
stitutr'varum, ut quae plurimum faciant et ad definitiones
(praesertim particulares) et ad divisiones sive partitiones
naturarum; de quo non male dixit Plato, Quod habendus sit
tanquam pro Deo, qui definire et diuidere bene sciat⁷⁸.

⁷⁸ See Phaedrus, 266 B: Τούτων δὴ ἔγωγε οὗτός rr ἐραστής, dr Φαῖδρε, τῶν
διαιρίσεων καὶ συναγωγῶν, ’ἶν’ οἶός τε ol hr‘yrw τε aul φρονεῖν· ε’άν τέ τιν’ ἄλλον
ἦγῆσωμαι δυνατὸν εἷς ἓν καὶ r'rrl πολλὰ πεφυκόό ὁρᾶν, τοῦτον διώκω κατόπισθε
μετ’ ἴχνιον ὥστε θεοῖο. l

²⁰ Tffls very important class of instances consists of ‘ Analogies' drawn
from objects or qualities in many respects dissimilar-at all times one of
the most fertile sources of suggestion both for scientific discoveries and
practical inventions. The imaginative and truly philosophical type of
mind which is adapted to note these resemblances is well described by
Bacon in i. 55.

Professor Playfair, giving examples of these instances, says : ‘Such are
the teleseope and microscope, in the works of art, compared with the eye
in·the works of nature. This, indeed, is an analogy which goes much
beyond the mere exterior; it extends to the internal structure, and to the
principle of action, which is the same in the eye andin the teleseope,—
to the latent schematism, in the language of Bncon, as faras material
substance is concemed. It was the experiment of the camera obscuro
which led to the discovery of the formation of the images of external
objects in the bottom of the eye by the action of the crystalline lens and
the other humours of which the eye is formed.

‘Among the instanees of conformity‚ those are the most useful'which
enable us to compare productione of an unknown formation, with similar
productioris of which the formation is well understood. Such are basalt,
and the other trap roclrs, compared with the lava thrown out from volca-
noes. They have a structure so exactly similar, that it is hardly possible
to doubt that their originis the same, and that they are both produced
by the action of subterraneous lire. There are, however, amid their
