vol. ii. pp. 299—300. From a comparison of these passages with that in
the text, itis plain that Bacon imagined the experiment to be successful,
and that be had thereby proved the compressibility of water. The fact
that the water exuded through the pores of the lead ought, however, to
have shown him that the experiment was one which could not be relied
upon.

‘This,¹ says Mr. Ellis, ‘is perhaps the most remarkable of Bacon¹s
experiments; and it is singular that it was so little spoken of by sub·
sequent writers. Nearly fifty years after the publication of the Novum
Organum, an account of a similar experiment was published by Megalotti,
who was secretary of the Accademia del Cimento at F lorence ; and it has

since been familiarly known as the F lorentiue experiment. 1 quote his
account of it. ‘Facemmo lavorar di getto una grande rna sottil palla
d’ argento, e quella ripiena d’ acqua rafireddata col ghiaccio serramo con
saldissime vite. Di poi cominciammo a martellaria leggiermente per ogni
verso, onde ammaccato l’ argento (il quale per la sua crudezza nou com·
porta d’ assottigliarsi e distendersi come farebbe l’oro ratiinato, o il plombo,
o altro metallo pid dolce) veniva a ristrignersi,e scemare la sua interna
capacita, senza che l' acqua patisse una minima compressione, poiche ad

ogni colpo si videa trasudare per tutti i pori del metallo a gulsa d’ argento
vivo il quale da alcuna pelle premuto minutamente sprizzasse.’-Saggi di

naturali Esperienze fatte nell' Accademia del Cimento, p. 204,F irenae, 1667.
The writer goes on to remark that the absolute incompressibility of water

is not proved by this experiment, but merely that it is not to be com·

pressed in the manner described. Eut the experiment is on other grounds
inconcluslve.

‘lt is to be remarked that Leibnitz, Nouveaux Essais, in mentioning the
florentine experiment, says that the globe was of gold lp. 229, Erdmann),
whereas the F lorentine academicians expressly say why they preferred
silver to either gold or lead!

Notwithstanding the unsatisfactory character of these experiments, the
compressibility of liquide has been fully demonstrated by Canton, Oersted,
and others. F or an account of the piesometer, the instrument which is
used for measuring the amount of compressibility of various liquide, see
Ganot’s Physics, rath Ed, ξ 97. Ether is much more compressible thau
