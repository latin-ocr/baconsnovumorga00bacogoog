332 NOVUM ORGANUM.

dicta sunt intelligimus: atque quemadmodum vulgaris logica,
quae regit res per syllogismum, non tantum ad naturales, sed

its parts, by pnrsuing this method, should at length be perlected, the
bounds 01 Moral Philosophy will be also enlarged. For so lar as we
can know by Natural Philosophy what is the First Cause, what power he
has over us, and what benefits we receive 110111 111111; so iar our duty
towards him, as well as that towards one another, will appear to us by the
light 01 Nature!

This Aphorism‚ notwithstanding certain passages inthe Novum Organum
which apparently point to the opposite conclusion, as, sor instance, in the
Preface, p. 187, and in Aphs. 29, 77, 128, affords conclusive evidence that
Baton contemplated the application 01 his method to the mental and
moral, as well as the natural sciences. The extended meaning 01 the
term ‘Natural Philosophy' (including ‘affectus et prehensiones intellec·
tuales ’), as employed 111 Αρ11. 80, appears to imply the same intention.
And, though, perhaps, there is nothing in Bacon's works strictly cor-
responding with the ‘historia et tabulae inveniendi deira, metu,’ dic, 01
which he speaks below, there are many places where he seems to assume
that such enquiriessall within the scope 01 his philosophy. Besides the
numerous passages in the later books 01 the De Augnrentis, the student
may refer to the Novum Organum, Bk. ii. Aphs. 26, 27, 35 ad fin.,‘Hist0ria
Vitae et Mortis (E. and S., vol. ii. pp. 170-174), Filum Labyrinthi, sive

' Inquisitio Legitima de Motu, ad fin. (E. and 5., vol. iii. pp. 639-40), “

Sylva Sylvarum, Exp. 795 and several ol the ‘experiments’ in the tenth
century. But, without multiplying references, l may state that it appears
to me unquestionable that Bacon, while he regarded his method as
primarily, and, perhaps, most easily applicable to the natural sciences,
contemplated its ultimate extension to all branches 01 knowledge alike.
Τ110 passages which seem to point in the opposite direction are, 1 con-
ceive, asl have already stated, ironical, and refer not to science, or know·
lcdge in the true sense, at all, but to rhetoric and disputation.

On the justness ol Bacon's view and 011 the sense or senses in which
lnduction is applicable to the moral and mental sciences, this is not the
place to speak lt may suffice to say that, in my opinion, certainty can
only be attained 111 these sciences by the employment, at all events in the
first instance, 01 the Inductive Method. Speculations, in these as in all
other subjects‚ unless based on the patient study ol facts, ‘variantur‚ 11011
augentur? The enormous extension which the method 01 Induction has
received in recent times by the application 01 a historical treatment to the
subjects of law, institutions, language, art, morals, religion, &c., has really
laid the basis 01 a scientific study 01 man, which may at some future time
rival in respect 01 certainty, while it will even transcend in interest, the
scientific study oi nature. The student who may wish to see successful
examples 01 this mode 01 treatment, the histon'cal malbod, as it has been
called, is referred to the works 01 Sir H. Maine, Professor Max Miller, Sir
J. Lubbock‚ Dr. 'sylon and (though here, perhaps, he will be treading on
less firm ground) to the Psycbology and Sociology 01 Mr. Herbert Spencer.
