adhuc lenior videtur ea flamma quae in nonnullis historiis fidis
et gravibus invenitur apparuisse circa capita et comas puero·
rum et virginum 96; quae nullo modo comas adurebat, sed
molliter circum eas trepidabat. Atque certissimum est, circa
equum ⁹⁷ in itinere sudantem noctu et suda tempestate appa-
ruisse quandoque coruscationem quandam absque manifesto
calore. Atque paucis abhinc annis, notissimum est et pro
miraculo quasi habitum gremiale cujusdam puellae paulo
' motum aut fricatum coruscasse3 quod fortasse factum est ob
alumen aut sales, quibus gremiale tinctum erat, paulo crassius
haerentia et incrustata, et ex fricatione fracta ⁹³. Atque cer·

tissimum est saccharum omne, sive conditum (ut vocant)
slve simplex, modo sit durius, intenebris fractum aut cultello

scalptum coruscare⁹⁹. Similiter aqua marina et salsa noctu
interdum invenitur, remis fortiter percussa, coruscare ¹. Atque

⁹⁸ See the story about Servius Tullius in Livy, i. 39, and about Ascanius
in Virg. Aen. ii. 679-86:
‘Talia vociferans gemitu tectum omne replebat,
Cum subitum dictuque oritur mirabile monstrum.
Namque manus inter maestorumque ora parentum
Ecce levis summo de vertice visus Iuli
Fundere lumen apex, tactuque innoxia mollis
Lambere flamma comas et circum tempora pasci.
Nos pavidi trepidare metu, crinemque flagrantem
Excutere et sanctos restinguere fontibus ignis!

Similar stories are told of some of the Saints, as, for instance, St. Cathe-
n'ne of Alexandria and St. Bridget.

⁹⁷ Cp. note on St. Elmo’s tire, below.

⁹⁸ ‘The girl's apron was probably made of silk, and the “coruscatio”
electric.' Dr. Kitchin's note.

⁰⁹ The crystais of sugar exhibit phosphorescence, when cut or rubbed.

¹ This beautiful phenomenon must be familiar to almost every one.
The following extracts (1 must apologise for their length) are taken from
Mr. Darwin's Naturalist's Voyage Round the World, ch. 8:

‘While sailing a little south of the Plata on one very darlr night, the
sea presented a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle. There was a
fresh breeze, and every part of the surface, which during the day is seen
as foam, now glowed with a pale light. The vessel drove before her
bows two billows of liquid phosphorus, and in her wake she was followed
by a miiky train. As far as the eye reached, the erest of every wave was
bright, and the slry above the horizon, from the reflected glare of these
livid flames, was not so utterly obscure as over the vault of the heavens.

‘As we proceed further southward the sea is seldom phosphorescent;
