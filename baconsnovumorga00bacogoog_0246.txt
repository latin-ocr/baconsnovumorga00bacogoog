Sunt etiam idola tanquam ex contractu et societate humani
generis ad Invicem, quae idola fori⁶⁴, propter hominum
commercium et consortium, appellamus. Homines enim

per sermones sociantur; at verba ex captu vulgi impo-
nuntur. Iraque mala et inepta verborum impositio miris
modis intellectum obsidet. Neque definitiones aut explica-
tiones, quibus homines docti se munite et vindicare in
nonnullis consueverunt, rem ullo modo restituunt. Sed verba
plane vim iaciunt intellectui et omnia turbant3 et homines

vim quandam seductoriam et quasi daemonem familiarem adesse, qui
mentem variis et vanis spectris ludat et turbet! It rnaybenoticed, hythe

a Iurther proos, if any were wanted, oI the sense in which Bacon employed
the latter word. Dr. Craik, in proposingto translate ‘Idola’ as ‘spectres’

⁵⁴ The idols of the maritet-place (or ‘palace,' Valerius Terminus) are so
called, because words (which are the ‘tesserae notionum,' Aph. 14) are
the means by which men carry on theIr ordinary intercourse in the affairs
oi lis . We exchange words as we exchange wares in the market.

In addition to the sections on the fallacies atising from the ambiguous
use ol terms, to be found in almost any treatise on Logic, the student
should read the third book ol Locke’s Essay, and especially chs. 9, 10, 11,
Dugald Stewart's Philosophy os the Humau Mind, pt. i. ch. 4, sects. 4, 5
with Note L, and pt. ii. second subdivision, ch. i. (Of Language), sect. 3,

⁶⁶ ‘Men take the words they find in use amongst their neighbours3 and,
that they may not seem ignorant what they stand for, use them confidently,
without much troubling their heads about a certain fixed meaning,
whereby, besides the ease of it, they obtain this advantage, that, as iu such
