⁸² Cp. the very interesting passages on the motion and velocity oi Sound
in Sylva Sylvarum, Exps. 207-11, where Bacon proposes an uperiment tor
the purpose ol determining the rate at which sound moves. ln principle
the experiment, which oonsists in comparing the time ol seeing a light with
that os hearinga sound, is the sams as that from which the velocityoi
sound has been actually ascertained. This in dry air and at ο· C is about
1093lt. in a second.

There are many stories oi the distances at which sounds have been
heard. The liring at Waterloo is said to have been heard at Dover, and
sometimes the reports oi cannon or volcanoes are said to have been carried
distances‘ of 200, or even 300 miles.

³³ This incapacity is due partly to the colour of the ball (ior we do seea
rocket), partly to the fact that the eye cannot adjust itsell with sufficient
rapidity to its constantly changing positions.

Note again, in the language ol the next sentence, the traces os the old
theory oi ‘ sensible species.’ Cp. Aph. 43 and note 99.

⁸* lt is almost needless to say that this ‘dubitatio plane monstrosa' has
been amply justified. ‘The measurement of the Velocityoi light,' says
Professor Playlair, ‘and the wonderful consequentes arising from it, are
the hest commentarios on this passage, and the highest eulogy on its
Author.'

. Taking the velocity ol light at 19o,0oo miles a second, it requires
8¹²¹ 18¹ to traversa a semi-diameter ol the earth’s orbit. Fron this datum
it is calculated that the light which the very nearest tired stus send us
