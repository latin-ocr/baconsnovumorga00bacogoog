⁶⁹ This excessive love of system, or tendency to feign parallels and
similitudes where none exist, is, in a logical classification of the fallacies,
best referred to False Analogy. See Mr. Mill's Logic, bk. v. ch. 5. ξ 6,
and tny Inductive Logic, 4th ed. pp. 326-338. The fanciful application of
numbers has always played a great part in fallacious conceptione of this
character. See a curious article on the number Seven in the Classical
Journal, vol. viii. One of the latest instances of the influence exercised.
on scientific researches by these speculations is afforded in the case of
Huyghens. ‘ The attention which Huyghens,’ says Professor Playfair (Pre-
liminary Dissertation to the Encyclopaedia Britannica)‚⁴ had paid to the
'ring of Satum‚ led him to the discovery of a satellite of the same planet.
His telescopes were not powerful enough to discover more of them than
one; he believed, indeed, that there were no more, and that the number
of the planets now discovered was complete. The reasoning by which he
convinced himself is a proof how slowly men are cured of their prejudices,
even with the best talents and the best information. The planets, pri-
mary and secondary, thus made up twelve, the double of six, the first of
the perfect numbers. In 1671, however, Cassini discovered another
satellite, and afterwards three more, making five in all, which the more
perfect telescopes of Dr. Herschell have lately augmented to seven?

lt must be remembered, however, that some of the greatest discoveries
in science have originated in the bold use of Analogy. Thus, the whole
science of Biology hasbeen revolutionised by following out the analogies
between vegetable and animal life, between fossil remains and living
organisms between the structure, habits, and faculties of the lower animals
and those of men. The extension of the idea of vave-motion to explain
the phenomena of light and soond, and the striking and startling analogies
which have often given the first clue to ascertaining the affinities of
languages, are other instances which will occur to almost every reader.

⁸⁰ The best commentary on this passage is to be found in the Thema
Coeli (E. and S.‚ vol. iii. pp. 774-5). ‘At manifestum est, planetas
non solum impari gradu contendere, sed nec ad idem punctum circuli
reverti, verum deflectere versus austrum et boream, cujus deflexionis
limites sunt tropici ; quae deflexio nobis circulum Obliquum, et Diversam
Politatem ejus progenuit3 quemadmodum illa celeritatis inaequalitas ι
motum illum Renitentiae. Neque vero hoc etiam commento naturae
rerum opus est, cum recipiendo lineas spitales (id quod proxime accedit
ad sensnm et factum) res transigatur, et ista salventur. Atque (quod
caput rei est) spirae istae nil aliud sunt quam defectiones a motu circulari
perfecto, cujus planetae sunt impatientes. Prout enim substantiae dege-
nerant puritate, et explicatione, ita degenerant et motus!

The whole passage from which this extract is taken is interesting, as
showing the immature character of Bacon’s astronomical theories.

ln a note on this Aphorism, Mr.Ellis says: ‘ lt does not appear in what
sense Bacon uses the word “draco'’ ln its ordinary acceptation in old
