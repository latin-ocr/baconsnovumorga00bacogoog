globo ipsi terrae3 at corpora caetera (gravia quae vocant et
levia, extra loca scilicet connaturalitatis suae sita) seruntur
recta ad massas sive congregationes similium; levia sursum,
versus ambitum coeli ; gravia deorsum, versus terram. Atque

At instantia foederis est cometa aliquis humilior3 qui cum
sit longe inira coelum, tamen rotat ⁶⁴. Atque commentum
Aristotelis ⁶⁶ de alligatione sive sequacitate cometae ad astrum

⁶³ This is the ordinary Peripatetic account oi what is called ‘motion oi
translation' (φορά), and is stated almost in the words of Aristode himself.
See, amongst other places, De Coelo, i. 2 (pp. 268 b-269 b), from which l
extract the following passage (p. 268 b. 17, rr.r.lt.): Πᾶσα ti κίνησις ὅση κατὰ
τόπον, ἦν καλοῦμεν φοράν, ἣ εὐθεῖα ἢ κύκλῳ ἣ έκ τούτων μικτή· ἁπλοῖ γὰρ οὗτοι
δύο μόναι. Αἴτιον δ’ ὅτι καὶ τὰ μεγέθη τοῦτο ἁπλᾶ priverni τ’ εὐθεῖα καὶ ἡ σκρι-
φφῆε. Κύκλῳ μὲν οὖν έστὶν ἦ περὶ τὸ μέσον, εὐθεῖα δ’ ἡ rivo arui κάτω. Λέγω
δ’ ἅνω μέν τὴν ἀπὸ τοῦ μέσον, κάτω δέ τὴν e'rri τὸ μέσον. ‘flur' ἀνάγκη πᾶσαν
εἶναι τὴν ἁπλῆν φορὸν τὴν μέν ἀπὸ τοῦ μέσον, τὴν δ’ r’rri ri μέσον, τὴν δέ περὶ
rd μέσον. The other parts oi the doctrine occur or are implied in the
same chapter: cp. also Phys. viii. 9 (265 a, b).

lt is not quite plain from Bacon’s words at the end oi the paragraph,
whether he implicitly accepted this account, or not. From Aph. 48,
‘Motus decimus septimus,’ it would seem as ii he did do so, whereas, in
the Descriptio Globi Intellectualis '(E. and S.‚ vol. iii. pp. 754-5), he
calls in question the dogmas of both the circular and the eternal rnotion
of the beavenly bodies (cp, with regard to the tormer, Nov. Org. i. 45).
This treatise must havebcen written about 1612, so that, unless we suppose
that, in the two passages oi the Novum Organnm, he is merely stating the
commonly received opinion, without thinking it necessary to criticise it,
we must admit some inconsistency in his treatment oi this subject.

The establishment ol the true nature and laws oi motion belongs to the
period subsequent to Bacon, beginning with the discoveries oi Galileo and
ending with those oi Newton. See Whewell's History oi the Inductive
Sciences.

⁸⁴ The comets being as much ‘heavenly bodies' as the planets, this
instance has, ot' course, no significance ior us.

There is another respect, however, as Dr. Kitcbin observes, in which
comets afford a good example os an Instantia Foederis. Notwithstanding
the apparent irregularity ol their orbits, they illustrate the Law ol Gravity
equally with the planets, whose orbits are apparently regular, and hence
their motions contribute to establish the universality oi that Law.

³⁵ See Meteorologica, i. 7 (p. 344). lt is not, however, with regard to
all comets that Aristotle propounds this theory. Ὀτον μὲν οὖν ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ
κάτω τόπῳ ἡ ἀρχὴ τῆς συστάσεως ᾔ, καθ’ ἑαυτὸν φαίνετον euphrae· ὅταν δ’ ὑπὸ
τῶν ἄστρων τινός, ἦ τῶν ἀπλανῶν ἦ τῶν πλονὴτων, ὑπὸ τῆς κινήσεως συνιστῆται
ri ἀναθυμίασις, τότε κομήτης γίγνεται τούτων τις· οὐ ydp repis circis ἡ κόμη
