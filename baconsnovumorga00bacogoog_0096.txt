and those branches ol' science to which the word ‘physics’ is osten
restricted, such enquiries are much rarer, but I question whether there
is any single science, other than mathematical, irorn which the idea of
adaptation can be strictly and consistently excluded. How we are to
interpret the fact os adaptation is a different question, and one which
by the great mass oi seientific enquirers would now be answered in
a iar different fashion from what ever occurred to any but a few
isolated thinkers in previous generations. The limits oi this Intro
duction being necessarily restricted, it is enough here simply to allude
to the theory oi Evolution, and to works such as those oi Mr. Darwin,
Mr. Wallace‚ and Mr. Herbert Spencer. To prevent, however, any
misconception oi my own opinions, 1 cannot reirain from repeating
here what I have already said in another place, that the main driit of
the arguments employed in Natural Theology is not affected hythe
modern theory ol' Evolution. Is 1 may be allowed to quote myseli,
‘1 am iar from denying that the Argument from Final causes, if it
talre sufficient account oi the evolution os organisms and their power
os adapting themselves to external circumstances, andis it be based
on the contemplation os Nature as a whole, instead os on that of
individual objects, may admit ol being stated in such a iorm as to
occupy once more an important position in any scheme os Natural
Theology. Bearing in mind these qualifications, it may be periectly
legitimate to speak, with reference to the universe at large, os design
anda designer, whatever may have been the agency, and however
mysterious and prolonged the process by which an intelligent
Creator may have worked. Theories of evolution nray be so
stated as not to impair, but indefinitely to exalt, our ideas os the
power, wisdom, and benevolence oi the Being in whom Nature
had its source Ψ

My conclusion, then, is, in briei, that Bacorr did not intend to ex·
clude the employment os the argument from Final Causea in Meta·
physics (or, as we should now rather say, Natural Theology ⁸⁰), while
his exclusion of it from the domain os physics was sar too rigid and

⁰ Bacon did not recognise any scienoe ol Metaphysics (in the ordinary sense oi
that term) as distinct from Natural Theology. See his letter to Father Baranam
(published in Spodding's letters and Life oi Bacon, vol. vii. pp. 375-7): ‘De
metaphysica ne sis sollicitus. Nulla enirn erit post veram Physicam inventam
ultra quam nihil praeter divina! Cp. pp. ¹5· 16 oi this Introduction. On p. 64
itwill have been seen that he sometimes employed the term in a peculiar sense
oi his own.
