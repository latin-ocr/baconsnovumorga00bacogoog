 

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. xix

De A tigmentis, of certain passages on the nature and
attributes of God, which occur in his earlier work T he
Aduancement of Learnz'ng. Dr. Abbott thinks that
the omissions and modifications in the De Augmentis,
as compared with the fuller and more definite theo-
logical statements in the Advancement, are intended
to avoid giving offence to Bacon's Roman Catholic
readers on the continent. But it so happens that the
passages to which Ι reserare not such as could have
given offence to Roman Catholic readers and hence
Ι cannot see how either my position or my argument
is affected by Dr. Abbott’s remarks.

This is hardly the place in which to discuss widi
Dr. Abbott matters exclusively affecting Bacon’s life or
personal character. But 1 may, perhaps, be allowed to
point out that, notwithstanding Dr. Abbott's apparent
surprise (pp. xv, 320) at my theory² that ‘the root
from which all Bacon’s errors and misfortunes
sprang’ was carelessness in money-matters, leading
to constant pecuniary difficulties, and, as a natural
result, to undue office-secking and an inordinate
craving for prescrment, his own account on p. 321 is
perfectly consistent with mine, providing only that we
bear in mind the well-known· psychological fact that
habits formed in early life often continue to act with
undiminished, or even increased force, though the
specific circumstances which gave birth to them have
ceased to operate. Unqualilied statements, however, of
this nature are usually erroneouS, and, perhaps Ι may

² Ι mn hardly, however, claim originality sor this theory, which was
probably suggested by a passage occurring at the end of Mr. Spedding’s
‘Life aud Times of Francis Bacon' as well as of the ‘ Letters and Life!
