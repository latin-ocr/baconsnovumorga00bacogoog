⁸⁸ l think that Bacon must here have in mind cosmica] clouds, in rte
interstellar spaces, not ordinary or aerial clouds. The argument is da·
the light ol the stars, il it took a long time lor its tmnsmission, would he
frequently stopped by various obstacles in the sky, whereas, on a clear
night, we invariablysee the stars where we expect to find thena. At ue
same time, it must be confessed that, il there were such obstacles as 1 aa
supposing Bacon to contemplate, the light might sometimes be intercepted
however instantaneous its transmission. There is, then, an undoubrei
difficulty in the passage, though it does not appear to me so great as ir
seems to appear to Mr. Spedding.

³⁹ The retention oi images on the retina ol the eye is a familiar pheno
menon, ol which the readervill easily supply himsell with instances. The
duration oi the persistence varies with the intensity ol the light and the
sensitiveness ol the orgen. ‘M. Plateau has investigated the duration οἱ
the impression by numerous methods, and has iound that it ison the
average hali a second. s ι u A great number oi pieees os apparatus are
founded on the persistence ol sensation on the retina. Such are the
thaumatrope, the phenalristoscope, Faraday’s wheel, the kaleidophone,
and the zoetrope’ Ganot’s Physics, rath Ed, ξ 625.

⁴⁰ Mr. Ellis says that ‘in the case ol vibrating strings Bacou's explana-
tionis not altogether complete. The distinct or quasi-distinct images ro
which he refers correspond to limiting positions oi the vibrating suing!

⁴² ‘This account ol Galileo’s theory ol the tides is inaccurate ln this
theory the tides are caused by the varying velocity ol different points ol
the earth's sudaee, arising lrom the composition oi the earth’s two
motione, namely that about its axis, and that in its orbit Bacon does not
seem to have perceived that both these metiens are essential to the
