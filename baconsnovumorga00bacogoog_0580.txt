partes tam aquei quam oleosi in alimentis suis multiplicat se,

statement oi the theory in Arist. De Gen. et Corr. ii.4 (p. 331). The
conversion ot water into air requires only the change oi one quality,
namely oi ‘coid’ into ‘warm,' the ‘moist’ being already common to the
two. ‘ibe intimate relation between air and water is spoken oi in a

variety oi ways. Thus in Phys. iv. 5 (p. 213 a. 1-4), Aristotle says (in
a passage already quoted) τ οὕτω δι’ troi ἀὴρ ἔχει πρὸς ὕδωρ· οἷον ὕλη yo'p, τὸ
δὲ εἶδος, rd pir ὕδωρ ὕλη ric'por, d di ἀὴρ οἷον ἐνέργειά rte ἐκείνου· rd γὰρ ὕδωρ
δυνάμει ἇήρ ἐστιν, 6 δ’ ἀὴρ δυνάμει ὕδωρ ἄλλον τρόπον. See also a curious
discussion in Meteorologica, i. 3 (339 a·341 a). Seneca (Nat. Quaest.
iii. ro) has a striking passage on the constant interchange oi the elements.

Patricius, who attacks the doctrine oi the transmutability of the elements
(Discuss. Peripatet. tom. iv. lib. 3. pp. 395-6), asirs very pertinently, who
ever saw air converted into water, or water into air. ‘Dicat mihi de
numero istorum philosophorum aliquis, an unquam viderint, observarint,
adrem in aquam converti? Scio ego, vidi, concedam, ex aqua et terra
in adrem vapores ascendere, aerem eos lieri nemo unquam vidit. ’Ν *¹*
Ar dixit [Aristoteles] aerem in aquam transmutari. Scio eum dixisse, sed
experimentum cur non attulit? Adierant sui pro eo.'

Bacon’s idea seems to bave been that air renews itseii, and ieeds, as
it were, on water, as flame renews itseli and ieeds on ‘vapours and oily
matter!

Air iucif, on the other hand, while in the lower regions, he appears
to have regarded as a fixed body, which does not admit oi resolution.
‘Ait autem corpus fixum est, nec solvitur: licet enim adr ex humido
aqueo novum aerem gignat, tamen vetus atr nihilominus manet ; unde
fit superoneratio illa aeris, de quo diximus in titulo de Ventis.¹ Hist.
Vitae et Mortis, as quoted in the next note. Cp. Historia Ventorum·
E. and S., vol. ii. pp. 42-3; 7 ς. But, in the upper regions, it is resolved .
again into water, this ‘reciprocation’ being a necessary conclusion ‘ex
conservatione rerum.¹ See Historia Densi et Rari, E. and S., vol. ii.
Ρ· ²93·

²⁶ On tbis absurd notion, cp. Historia Vitae et Mortis, Canon 32, E. and
S., vol. ii. pp. 225-6.

²⁸ ἐπιούσιον, sufficient ior the day, or proper ior their sustenance. The
word is, oi course, adopted from the Lord's Prayer (Matt vi. 11 ; Lulre
xi. 3). On the various opinions as to the meaning and derivation oi this
word, the two translations in the Vulgare (supersubstantialem-quotidi-
anum), and the celebrated dispute thence arising between St. Bemard
and Abelard (see Morison's St. Bemard, rst Ed, p. 313, tto), it would be
travelling beyond my present province to speak.
