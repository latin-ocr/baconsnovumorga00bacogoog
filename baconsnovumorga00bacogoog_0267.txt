At &wladimiri innata non sunt, nec occulto insinuata in
intellectum 11; sed ex fabulis theoriarum, et perversis legibus
demonstrationum, plane indita et recepta. In his autem
confutationes tentare et suscipere consentaneum prorsus non
est illis, quae a nobis dicta sunt. Quum enim nec de princi-
piis consentiamus, nec de demonstrationibus, tollitur omnis
argumentatio. Id vero bono fit sat0‚ ut antiquis suus constet
honos¹¹. Nihil enim illis detrahitur, quum de via omnino
quaestio sit. Claudus enim (ut dicitur) in via antevertit
cursorem extra viam. Etiam illud manifesto liquet, currenti
extra viam, quo habilior sit et velocior, eo majorem contingere
aberrationem.

Nostra vero inveniendi scientias ea est ratio, ut non multum
ingeniorum acumini et robori relinquatur3 sed quae ingenia
et intellectus sere exaequet¹³.· Quemadmodum enim ad hoc

¹¹ The words ‘insinuata in intellectum' apply to the Idola Fori. For
the various divisions of the ldola given in the different works ol Bacon,
see notes on Aphs. 38, 39. We have here a trace of the old division into
‘innata' including the ldola Tribus and Idola Specus, and ‘adscititia,’
which were co-extensive with the Idola Theatri. Cp. pp. 174, 175.
The Idola F ori, as falling under neither division, created a difficulty, and
seem here to be regarded as intenuediate between the two.

The two divisions ol the ldola Theatri, namely, those arising from
lalse systems ol philosophy and those arising from perverse laws ol
. demonstrationum sometimes treated by Bacon‚ as, lor instance, in the
Distributio Operis, as if they were distinct classes os Idola. Corresponding
with them, he proposes to lnmish in the Novum Organum a ‘Redargutio
Philosophiamm’ and a ‘Redargutio Demonstrationum.¹ But these ‘Redar-
gutiones,' it will be found, are not kept altogether distinct in the Aphorisms
which follow. With the remaining ‘ ldola' corresponds the ‘Redargutio
Rationis humanae nativae.¹ Cp. p. 175.

¹¹ ln this and similar passages, which abound throughout the Novum
Organum, we cannot fail to notice an air ol contemptuous superiority.
‘Why should l conteud with the ancients lor the palm os genius, when
it is enough forme that l am on the right road, and they on the wrong
one. Let them run as last as they like. They will only run the further
from the truth.’

¹³ Commenting on this passage, Macaulay (Essay ⁰¹¹. Bacon) says: ‘This
really seems to us as extravagant as it would have been in Lindley hlurrny
to announce that every body who should leam his Grammar would write
as good English as Dryden, or in that very able writer, the Archbishop
ol Dublin, to promise that all the readers ol his Logic would reason like
