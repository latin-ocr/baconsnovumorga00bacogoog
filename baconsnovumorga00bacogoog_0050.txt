of my readers who are at all acquainted with the subsequent develop
ment of Moral Philosophy in England will not fail to find in this
sentence the germ of one of the leading ideas in the systems of
Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, and many other English writers.

With the more minute divisions of Good, and with the details of
Bacon's moral system generally, Ι need not trouble the reader, who
can easily consult this part of the De Augmentis for himself ³⁷.

Tbere are, however, one or two points which deserve special
notice. Thus, Bacon, like all other English writers, down, 1 believe,
to the time of Hobbes, makes morality ultimately dependent on
theology. Ethics is the hand-maid of theology, and, though it may
contain much useful instruction within its own limits, it must always
be subservierit to the master-science. ‘Quod si quis objiciat ani-
morum curationem Theologiae Sacrae munus esse, verissimum est
quod asserit3 attamen Philosophiam Moralem in famulitium Theolo-
giae recipi instar ancillae prudentis et pedissequae fidelis, quae ad
omnes ejus nutus praesto sit et ministret, quid prohibeat? Etenim
quemadmodum in Psalmo habetur, quod omli ancillae perpetrm ad
manus dominae respiciunt, cum tamen minime dubium sit, quin haud
pauca ancillae judicio et curae relinquantur, eodem modo et Ethica
obsequium Theologiae omnino praestare debet, ejusque praeceptis
morigera esse ; ita tamen ut et ipsa, intra suos limites, haud pauca
sana et utilia documenta continere possit³⁸.' Of course, this point of
view is hardly consistent with the comprehension of ethics under the
sciences admitting of an inductive treatment ⁸⁹, but, then, at this
stage in the history of ethical thought, we must not expect con·
sistency, except in writers, like Hobbes, who had devoted special
attention to the ultimate grounds of moral and political ideas. An
inconsistency of another kind may be found in Bacon's anxiety to
liberate natural philosophy from the control of theology, notwith-
standing his readiness to subordinate to that science moral philq
sophy and, as we have seen, even a portion of psychology.

It may be noticed also that Bacon finds a special argument for the
divine origin of the Christian religion in its marked preference of the
