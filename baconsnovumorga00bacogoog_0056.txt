attacked the Peripatetic doctrine of the transmutabilityol the elements,
Bacon evidently believed that air and water, under certain conditions,
were mutuallyconvertible. Thus in the Novum Organum, ii. 48<11),
on which see my note, he absurdly speaks oi air ‘qui super aquarn
et aquea multiplicat se, et generat novum aerem,' while air, though
a lixed body in the parts immediately above the earth, is resolved
again into water in the upper regions ol the atmosphere ⁵⁶.

Connected with this idea oi the transmutability oi air and water
is the strange theory, which he appears to have received without
question, that lountains originate in the condensation ol air within
the hollow parisos the earth. See Historia Densi et Rari (E. and S.,
vol. ii. p 293), and Novum Organum, ii. 50 (3), with my note on
the latter passage.

The transmutability ol metals was another fancy which Bacon, in
part at least, accepted. Thus, in the Historia Densi et Rari (E. and
S., vol. ii. pp. 250, 251), though he doubts the possibility ol manu·
iacturing gold, on account oi its great neight and density, he has
great hopes ol producing silver by the conversiones lead or quick-
silver: ‘Verum versio argenti vivi aut plumbi in argentum (curn
argentum sit illis rarius) habenda est pro sperabili; cum tantum
linationem et alia quaedam innuat, non densationem.’ In the Sylva
Sylvarum (Exps 326—328), however, though he finds much fault
with many of the lancisul coneeits of the Alchemists, his hopes seem
to have risen, and he actually proposes a recipe lor the ‘making oi
gold' The general question of the transformation ol bodies is dis·
cussed in Nov. Org. ii. 5. This lancy, or, as, perhaps, we might
rather call it, sanguine expectation, Ι arn not inclined to visit very
severely on Bacon. Though we may not be able to superinduce the
‘forms' of the various ‘simple natures' which constitute gold, yet,
ii we could discover that it was a compound, we might be able to
put together the elements ol which it consists, and thus produce it
artificially. Moreover, an error, ii such it be⁵⁷, which was shared
with Boyle, whose special business was with this class ol questions,
and treated without disrespect by Newtonll, may well be pardoned
