real genius, and there must be many men who recollect the transition
from dry manuals oi Logic to the proiound and brilliant pages oi
Bacon as forming one ol the eras in their lives. Maxims such as
these, ‘Homo naturae minister et interpres,’ ‘Scientia et potentia
hnmana in idem coincidunt,’ ‘Lucifera experimenta, non fructifera,
quaerenda’ ‘Recte veritas temporis filia dicitur, non auctoritatis,’
‘Pessima res est errorum apotheosiq’ which sparlde on almost every
page, live long in the memory, and insensibly influence our whole
habit os thought. This educational value os the Novum Organum
has never, I think, been sufficiently pointed out, but it seems to me
very real and very important. As I have already noticed under the
last section, there is something about Bacon’s diction, his quaintness
os expression, and his power oi illustration‚ which lays hold oi the
mind, and lodges itseli in the memory, in a way which we hardly
find paralleled in any other author, except it be Shalrspeare. And
what are the lessons which he thus effectually communicatos? The
duty oi taking nothing upon trust which we can veriiy ior ourselves ;
os rigidly examining our first principles ; os being careiully on our
guard against the various delusione arising lrom the peculiarities ol
human nature, from our various interests and pursuits, from the lorce
oi words, and from the disputes and traditions oi the schools 3 the
duty ol ionning our conclusions slowly and ol constantly checking
them by comparison with the facts ol nature and liie ; os avoiding
merely subtle and irivolous disputations3 ol confining our enquiries to
questions oi which the solution is within our power; and oi subordi-
nating all our investigations to the wellare os man and society.
Now, lessons such as these, even though they be stated in a some-
what exaggerated sonu, are so necessary and so usesul, that an author
who presents them in sorcible and pointed language will ever retain
his interest and utility ior each succeeding generation os leamers.
As regards the second of these questions, the amount ol definite
logical teaching in Bacon's works which retains apermanent value,
the answer is less easy. I cannot, however, agree with those critics
who seem to think that almost all his individual precepts are either
antiquated or worthless⁸⁴. But, as I have expressed mysell sully

⁸⁴ Not to merrtion Liebig and Bacon's professed adversaries, we find ewen De
Remnsat saying (p. ²54) z ‘Eacou n’a point rectifie ou remplaod les notione recues
qu’il condamne, ou oea conceptione scientifiques des choses, sans lesquelles tonte
recherche marche au hasard. Ainsi point de reoette slire, point de methode inteil-
