382 NOVUM ORGANUM.

neque differat res a forma, aliter quam differunt apparens et
existens, aut exterius et interius aut in ordine ad hominem
etin ordine ad universum ²³ ; omnino sequitur ut non reci-
piatur aliqua natura pro vera forma, nisi perpetuo decrescat
quando natura ipsa decrescit, et similiter perpetuo augeatur
quando natura ipsa augetur³⁰. Hanc itaque tabulam Tabu-
lam Graduum sive Tabulam comparativae appellare consue-
vtmus.

ἵ Tabula Graduum sive Comparativae in Calido.

Primo itaque dicemus de iis quae nullum prorsus gradum
caloris habent ad tactum, sed videntur habere potentialem
tantum quendam calorem, sive dispositionem et praepara·
tionem ad calidum. Postea demum descendemus ad eaquae
sunt actu sive ad tactum calida, eorumque fortitudines et
gradus.

1. In corporibus solidis et tangibilibus non invenitur aliquid
quod in natura sua calidum sit originaliter ³¹. Non enim lapis
aliquis, non metallum, non sulphur, non fossile aliquod, non

²⁹ nris is only another way ol stating the contrast ol ‘apparens' et
‘existens' oia thing or quality as it appears to us, and as it is in its
own inmost nature. Thus, heat, as affecting the senses, is ‘in ordine ad
hominem,' while its cause or essence, a motion ol a certain kind amongst
the minute particles ol matter, is ‘in ordine ad universum.¹ Aristotle's
distinction ol πρότερα or γνωριμώτερα πρὸς »ipris and πρότερα or yyopt'pr'orrpn
τῇ φύσει, as applied respectively to individuals and species, is, it will be
noticed, here transferred to the relation ol an effect to its cause or a
phenomenon to its esseoce

³⁰ This rule, so lar as it affects the relation ol cause and effect, is vitiated
hythe consideration os the Plurality ol Causas. As an effect may be
due to two or more distinct causes, being sometimes produced by one aad
sometimes by another, it is quite conceivahle that one ol the causes might
remain altogether unchanged‚ while the effect increased or diminished
concurrently with the other cause or with one ol the other causes. This
objection does not apply to the Canon ol the Method ol Concomitaqt
Variations as stated by Mr. Mill or mysell.

³¹ What Bacon means is that there' rs no tangible body which tn its
ordinary condition, aflects the skin with the sensation ol heat. The
purely relative and negative character ol ‘ cold,' and the laws oi radiation
and conduction, we must recollect, were alike unknown to him.

By ‘cold' Bacon, ol course, means a temperature lower than that ot
the skin.
