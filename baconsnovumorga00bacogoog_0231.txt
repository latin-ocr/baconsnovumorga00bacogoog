Eandem ingreditur viam (priorem scilicet) intellectus sibi

statement of the forces which the earth exerts upon the moon, and the
sun upon the earth. Again, this doctrine of the forces 01 these three
bodies is included in the assertion, that all the bodies of the solat system,
and all parts of matter, exert forces, each upon each. And we might easily
shew that all the leading facts in astronomy are comprehended in the same
generalisation. In like manner with regard to any other science, so faras
its truths have been well established and fully developed, we might shew
that it consists of a gradation of propositions, proceeding from the most
special facts to the most general theoretical assertions.' (Novum Orgauum
Renovatum, ch. vi. § 1.)

Even in Astronomy‚ however, the heliocentric hypothesis had occurred
to the ancients long before the state of their knowledge was sufficient
to supply them with souud arguments for it; nor, even in the time of
Copernicus himself, was it more than the simplest and most consistent
explanation of known facts.

The student is specially recommended to read Mr. Mill’s strictures on
this Aphorism. See Mill’s Logic‚ bk. vi. ch. 5. ξ 5. 011 the other side, he
may refer to Dr. Whewell's Philosophy of Discovery, ch. xxii. ξ 56-62.

ln extenuation of Bacon’s error, for such 1 conceive it to be, may be
pleaded the exceedinglyvague and unsatisfactorycharacter of the‘axiomata
maxime generalia’ which were in vogue in his time. As proof of this
circumstance, I may cite the list which Mr. Mill himself gives at the
beginning of the 24th chapter 01 his Examination of Sir W. Hamilton's
Philosophy.

Notwithstanding all that is said here and in other places, Bacon himself
had recourse to hypothesis (under the name of ‘permissio intellectus ’1 in
11. ao. The view which he there takes of its relation to Induction is far
more just than that here taken. See my note on the beginning of that
Aphorism.

²³ The mind is naturally prone to the false method, and is encouraged in
its tendencies by the use of the vulgar logie, which fails to insist on the
examination of first principles. This proueness of the mind to rest in
first principles, however obtained, and to resent any examination 01 them,
is due mainly to a combination 01 pride with mental indolence. We recoil
from the trouble 01 reviewing what lies at the bottom 01 so many 01 our
beliefs, and we are too proud to acknowledge that we have been so long or
so frequently in error. To a certain extent, also, it may be accounted for
